&lt;p>&lt;strong>Child&lt;/strong> : How come you get to eat icecream on the couch?
&lt;br/>
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : Because I have my Icecream Licence!&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This was intended as a joke but lead to me outlining the key competencies you
have to demonstrate to access this licence:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t spill icecream on the couch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you do, you notice it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You know how to clean spills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You actually clean those spills&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As of writing this, my oldest has the licence, my youngest has decided they&amp;rsquo;re
not ready for the responsibility yet, and happily eat at the table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? I was exhausted by repeat queries, and while &amp;ldquo;because I said so&amp;rdquo; is sometimes
appropriate, it&amp;rsquo;s more often a lazy response which doesn&amp;rsquo;t support learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reflections">Reflections
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Icecream Licence&lt;/strong> was bootstrapped directly off the Drivers Licence. In
the case of the car we want people to have agency in their life, and to balance
that freedom with the safety of other citizens. In the case of the
icecream, I want my kids to relax and have fun, AND I want a harmonious house
(one where I&amp;rsquo;m not yelling &lt;em>STICKY FINGERS ARGGHH!!!!&lt;/em> nor resentfully sponging
dairy out of soft furnishings).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My ultimate goal is for my kids to be fully autonomous, self-actualizing,
socially integrated humans. There are lot of places freedom is dangerous (to
self and/or others). The &amp;ldquo;Licence&amp;rdquo; is a really clear way to support people to
grow into that freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very similar to an education context, which works in &amp;ldquo;qualifications&amp;rdquo;,
often defined by &amp;ldquo;key competencies&amp;rdquo; which need to be demonstrated in some
way. Qualifications are usually used to boundary access to additional course/
programmes/ jobs. Licences are a sort of qualification which often boundary
something dangerous to an individual / group / system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qualifications and Licences are both awarded by &amp;ldquo;authorities&amp;rdquo; - entities we&amp;rsquo;ve
invested with the right to author, and to authorise (extend authorship/
autonomy). There&amp;rsquo;s a clear power dynamic in here, which needs some attention
and care. While I still often hold the ultimate authority, the shift has been
towards defining access to power, and supporting my kids to access that safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels great to shift from &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;No, because I said so&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, to &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Yes, when you can
demonstrate X,Y,Z, are you ready?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-licences">Creating Licences
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not everything should be a Licence. However we&amp;rsquo;ve found it a very succinct way
to communicate with our kids:
&lt;br />
a) There is something adult or dangerous here &amp;#x1f525;
&lt;br />
b) There is a pathway, I&amp;rsquo;m here to support you &amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some reflective questions to support you explore Licences:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-are-you-really-blocking-your-child">Why are you &lt;em>really&lt;/em> blocking your child?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably been giving your child &amp;ldquo;some reason(s)&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s likely
truncated because you lacked the time, and your child lacks context. Pause and
unpack it more fully. This provides hints about what your child might
need to learn / master.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>e.g. icecream isn&amp;rsquo;t directly dangerous, but it can attract animals, breed
microbes, damage relationships&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-doing-this-well-look-like">What does doing this well look like?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>You are likely unaware of how many points of context + skills are involved with
some domains. Happily, you can probably imagine a lot of ways your child
would fail. Use these as pointers to mapping our explicitly the pieces of
knowledge and skills required.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-you-fail-well-here">How do you &amp;ldquo;fail well&amp;rdquo; here?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Just because adults &amp;ldquo;know how to do something&amp;rdquo; does not mean they nail it every
time. A key aspect of mastery is knowing how to adapt &lt;strong>when&lt;/strong> failure occurs -
often this involves sensing failure early, and knowing how to gently correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>what does this look like when it goes wrong?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>what are the best options for recovering/ mitigating damage?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="could-this-licence-have-levels">Could this Licence have levels?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>How can we practice basics and succeed before adding more context/ complexity/
skills?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>e.g. ice-cream in a bowl, in a cone, with/ without chocolate sauce (see
Dangerous Goods Licence)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="licence-revocation">Licence revocation?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In our house you can definitely lose your Icecream Licence. Sounds kinda
punitive perhaps, but we&amp;rsquo;ve found having clear expectations about what&amp;rsquo;s
involved with a Licence makes it really easy to outline outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s totally ok to not want to have responsibility for everything all the time!
If you want to pause on some of those responsibilities, it just means that some
of your freedom/ autonomy may be curtailed. We align power with responsibility

&lt;p>The cellular network is great, AND you should expect it to be disrupted. Cell
towers require a lot of power, and intact data/phone lines. If one goes down,
others take on more load, and when everyone is over-loading networks trying
to connect, they&amp;rsquo;re even less reliable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; what do we do?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mesh-networks">Mesh Networks
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A mesh network is made up of many devices, each of which can talk to it&amp;rsquo;s
neighbour. In a mesh network you can get a message across the city by passing
it through a series of peers. The good news is there&amp;rsquo;s already an active mesh
in Wellington, and joining it will only make communication more resilient.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some interesting things to note about this mesh network&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>what a mess!&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; correct, this is mostly an uncoordinated (ad-hoc)
network. It evolves over time as nodes move, turn on/ off. Messages just take
the paths that are open and it mostly &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>how come some line are real long?&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; some devices are on top of mountains,
and/ or have special antennas, which means signals can jump further (like the
top of the South Island).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>isn&amp;rsquo;t revealing your location a security risk&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; Yes! Not all devices opt
into broadcasting their position, i.e. there are likely more devices in the mesh
that pictured. I believe you can also choose to have a &amp;ldquo;rough&amp;rdquo; location
broadcast so people others can map your neighbourhood, but not your (latitude,
longitude)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

but we can easily add that functionality via a Bluetooth accessory.&lt;/p>

Two phones message via LoRa devices they are each connected to.
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This recipe gives you &lt;strong>text messaging&lt;/strong> + GPS location over a mesh network.
The battery on the LoRa device should last a couple days, and not take much to
charge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I recommend you buy parts for you and a friend - you immediately have someone
you can communicate with AND you further strengthen the mesh for the wider

&lt;p>The T1000e is the device I&amp;rsquo;m recommending. It works out of the box, requires
only a little setup, and there was no command-line hacking. You connect to it
via Bluetooth and it takes care of all the LoRa stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NOTE: you need 1 x T1000e per person&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Meshtastic is an open-source project with builds mesh-networks via LoRa devices.
It&amp;rsquo;s been designed to work with a range of devices, and lets you configure them
via Bluetooth. It is also the main interface by which you message other peers in
the network - there is functionality for public messages, private group chat
(encrypted), and direct messages (encrypted)&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&amp;#x26a0;&amp;#xfe0f; use a name other than your full legal name. Recommended because the device
by default reveals your approximate position (within 100m)&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>Turn off that beep!&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>When you receive a new message, the default behaviour of the Sensecap is
for it to beep repeatedly. You can dismiss that beeping by pushing the power
button on the Sensecap once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If dislike beeps (and are happy with just notifications on your phone):&lt;/p>

&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>Change your Position settings&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>By default this device broadcasts your approximate position (within 100m).
You can change this up or down depending on your context (safety/ privacy).&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Push the vertical ellipsis &lt;strong>⋮&lt;/strong> (top-right)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &amp;ldquo;Radio Config&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="important-info">Important Info
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Message delivery is not guaranteed.&lt;/strong> There are several ways a message may not
make it to the person you want it to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Your device is not in range of any other
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>e.g. you are alone in an isolated valley&lt;/li>
&lt;li>e.g. there are heaps of buildings blocking you in&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no pathway from you to your friend
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>your message makes it to another device, is passed on, &amp;hellip; but doesn&amp;rsquo;t
make it as far as your intended recipient&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Missing messages is a side-effect of Meshtastics approach to replicating data.
Not all mesh systems have this problem, and this is a space that is being
&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/tiny-ssb" >actively researched&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design of Meshtastic does let you see &lt;strong>some&lt;/strong> information about delivery:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="direct-message-delivery">Direct Message Delivery
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In the case of direct messages, there are 4 symbols you see&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="group-chat-delivery">Group Chat Delivery
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In group chats it is much less clear. You may get some confirmation of delivery,
but I would only trust this to mean it was acknowledged by &lt;em>some member&lt;/em> of that
group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should discuss with your community what your protocol is for adapting to
this. A simple one would be to put thumbs-up on messages that have been
received.&lt;/p>

A: I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Be aware that as it&amp;rsquo;s currently built your &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo; if bound
to your T1000e (not your phone), meaning if 2 phones are connected, they will
both be see to other mesh nodes as the same author.&lt;/p>

approach to signed, append-only logs, but radically modifies the format to fit
packets of 120 Bytes (including a cryptographic signature). This makes messaging
small enough to fit over &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>LoRa&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Bluetooth Low-Energy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
Phones replicating with nearby T-Beams via BLE, which are in turn replicating
over great distances via LoRa
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The basic idea is you use your phone (or any device really) to publish messages
(text/ audio), and then those messages are replicated over long distances using
relays (for example using LoRa - a low power, radio protocol). Because all are
messages are cryptographically signed, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about trusting
intermediaries (relays, other peers). Other ways messages can be relayed is
directly from device-to-devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (requires zero
pairing, peers just need to be within a few meters, and be interested in what
each other are &amp;ldquo;saying&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>These patterns were born of the death of a friendship. TL;DR we muddled
personal and work comms to the point where communication got confused, and
trust broke down. We managed to name the problem, but too late to be able to
recover. I was gutted &amp;ndash; I was naive, complicit, and had lost a dear friend. My
response was to start partitioning my comms, obsessively asking:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is the best space to relay this message into?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time this query has evolved
how I think and relate. Please enjoy a sampler of how I use Signal, presented
as an explorable simulacrum &amp;ndash; &lt;em>click in to read more about those you&amp;rsquo;re
curious about.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="work-chats">Work Chats
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>These were the first. In Signal I started creating dedicated 1:1 chats to
protect against this mistake. Here&amp;rsquo;s how that looks:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class='chats'>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>😀&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Ben&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>If I write something in here it&amp;rsquo;s me writing to Ben as a
friend. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry I&amp;rsquo;m coming at him with some work request, this
is about us connecting as friends.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details open=true>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>💼&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Ben/ Mix work&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>Work coordination. If it&amp;rsquo;s out-of-office hours, this can wait.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;p>&amp;#x2139;&amp;#xfe0f;   &lt;em>click to expand&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="family-chats">Family Chats
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Another reason I shifted hard into more exobrain use is also that having babies
turned my endobrain into mush. Gotta record everything or it&amp;rsquo;s gone. Here are
some chat groups that are just me and my partner &amp;ndash; our collective memory,
sense-making, and futuring.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class='chats'>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>🏡&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Family Admin&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>Boring but necessary house + kid stuff. I got scared that this would dominate all
my communication with my partner. Like the &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; chat above it allows us to protect
our relationship (somewhat) from the onslaught of logistics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon icon-first-aid'>+&lt;/div>

&lt;p>A memory augmenting channel. Dumping observations that are maybe insignificant,
but could be vital as part of a bigger arc is an easy win. Our whole family health
is in here, but to give you an idea, here&amp;rsquo;s a slice of one pattern we spotted that
lead to an escalation in care:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Time&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Message&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Sep 24, 11pm&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; right ear pain → paracetamol&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Nov 07, 8pm&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; right ear sore, stopped then started.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Feb 19, 10am&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; doctor says ear looks ok, referring to ENT&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Mar 12, 2am&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; woke with ear pain (left only)&lt;br /> - gave half paracetamol&lt;br /> - may have had some liquid come out (swimming, or burst drum?)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Mar 25, 8pm&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; ear seemed to clear &amp;ldquo;everything is so loud&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>We dump details about night wake-ups (invaluable for handing over care context),
medicine administered, readings (height/ weight/ blood pressure/ temperature),
questions for doctors, appointment times, notes from doctors visit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Format&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; &lt;code>name&lt;/code> + &lt;code>topic/ body area&lt;/code> + &lt;code>info&lt;/code> &lt;br />
Makes patterns easy to search. Timestamps are essential, but auto-added by chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>🌈&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Read/ Watch&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>A record of books / films / series that we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered and would like to
queue up. Raw titles alone means you lose the context for &lt;em>why&lt;/em> this caught your
attention, so I&amp;rsquo;d recommend a format like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>title&lt;/code> + &lt;code>genre&lt;/code> + &lt;code>link?&lt;/code> + &lt;code>why?&lt;/code>
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>🎉&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Family Dreams&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Origin&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; My friend Richard and his partner have a bowl of cards, and on the cards
are written fun activities. When they&amp;rsquo;re bored they pull a card from the bowl, and
they&amp;rsquo;re off on adventure. I copied that. When my partner or I come across a recommended
location, fun kids activity, or upcoming event, they get dumped into this chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s like a shared memory space&amp;hellip; but for for possible futures. This
chat has increased our capacity for bringing dreams into the world. We started at
simple (&lt;em>Real Fruit Ice-cream&lt;/em>), and have grown in scale (&lt;em>International trip with
another family&lt;/em>), and depth (&lt;em>Take a night-class to explore this shy aspect of myself&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot recommend this pattern enough.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Origin&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; We have two young kids and wanted to remember some of the crack-up things
they&amp;rsquo;ve said.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Time&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Message&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Jan 14&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Son&lt;/strong> : I have the opposite program to most people. I have my dreams while I&amp;rsquo;m awake instead of while I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Apr 19&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Daughter&lt;/strong> : I feel bad, like I hurt someone&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s just that I fell in love with tacos&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Apr 21&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Daughter&lt;/strong> : hey I&amp;rsquo;m following you, you&amp;rsquo;re the role model&lt;br />&lt;strong>Grandma&lt;/strong>: don&amp;rsquo;t follow me &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t know where I&amp;rsquo;m going!&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; One of the greatest gift kids offer is the chance to see the world
afresh. Their observations are uncoloured by idioms, uncluttered by&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;grown up&amp;rsquo;
context? Their questions side-step social norms and drive (unknowing or sensing?)
into the heart of things. We&amp;rsquo;re invited to reflect on our assumptions, our knowledge,
what we really values, and to summarise those thoughts in under 2mins in simple terms.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>Mar 2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>mix&lt;/strong> : &amp;ldquo;remind me about leadership call&amp;rdquo;?! &lt;br /> &lt;strong>partner&lt;/strong> : thanks! I scheduled that message 5 days ago, you&amp;rsquo;re like my meatware in this situation &lt;br /> &lt;strong>mix&lt;/strong> : I am your meatware, that&amp;rsquo;s what we signed up for &lt;br /> &lt;strong>partner&lt;/strong> : awww&lt;/td>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; reflecting on what having a &amp;ldquo;premium subscription&amp;rdquo; might mean,
I noticed this channel was a perfect place to post post celebrations of beauty
we see unfolding in our lives, appreciation of one another, and the occasional
insights from therapy.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>

>comedy video&lt;/a>,
this started as a high-context, high-trust channel for my partner and I to
vent about those cringe or painful moments in life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; Laughing together at a predicament is a quick way to affirm
shared values and step away from any fight/flight/freeze/fawn response.
If it&amp;rsquo;s not funny, then we can move into more careful support of each other.
Whatever the path, stabilisation/ alignment/ destressing make it easier to
engage curiosity, name the kernel of any conflict, explore upstream solutions,
etc.

&lt;p>This is a simple shared memory archive. When we decide on an iteration
of something we&amp;rsquo;d like to try out, we record it here. This helps us
loop back to reflect on how experiments have gone. Later this will likely
enable us to reflect on what we continue to struggle with, how far we&amp;rsquo;ve
come, and what our relationship is.

&lt;p>A support group for a group of 18 parents who were friends and happend
to have kids around the same time. This group has covered planning
playdates, re-sharing cool event, shared summer holidays for the past 4
years, hand-me-downs, baby-sitting, emergency support, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I deliberately added sharing of vulnerability to this group. I role-modelled
&lt;em>not knowing&lt;/em>, I asked for help. I was met with support, and observing
safety and care, others followed suit. I think this deepened relationships,
increased resilience, and turbo-charged our collective sense-making.

&lt;p>I met a nice guy at &lt;a class="link" href="https://dwebcamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dweb Camp&lt;/a>, and said &amp;ldquo;we should
keep in touch!&amp;rdquo;. He dropped me into a Signal chat with 23 people called
&amp;ldquo;Social Labryinth&amp;rdquo; with zero context. Turns out this was a group of people
that were mostly friends of his at the conference, along with a handful of
seemingly aligned odd-bods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have never seen such sustained and rich discourse beyond a conference. I
attribute this to the lovely host, their great taste in friends, and our
alignment in interests (all at a radical tech conference). This group went
on to birth another parallel group, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/decent-social" >online conference&lt;/a>,
and many of the people I met are now trusted peers and collaborators.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The origin of this group are somewhat shrouded in mystery. It &lt;em>seems&lt;/em> like
I made it as a joke in 2023 and then forgot about it, only to stumble across
it a year later while searching my chat for clowns.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the past year this chat has evolved into a critical discourse on clowning,
their role as bridges between possible realities, and has been slowly gathering
real clowns who are now helping shape the conversation. Was I always a clown,
or am I becoming one?
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>

&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>I met an Ecologist at a conference, and really wanted to learn more about the
systems thinking lenses of Ecology, and how this person had been applying them
to groups. We are both short on time, so started a chat group as a way to
share learning through dialogue. Along the way we&amp;rsquo;ve been adding resources
and people that match the theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We could have just kept this as a DM chat, but opening this to trusted friends
we were able to share learning more widely while also building trust as we
observe mutual friends interacting.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is an off-shoot from a chain of collaborations between myself and
&lt;a class="link" href="https://nonlinear.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>nonlinear&lt;/a>. We share a passion for building
human-centred digital commons. A major challenge is there are so many
open-source projects / tools that auditing and testing them as an
individual is overwhelming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The focus of this group is then &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;do you have a spare 30 mins to kick the
tyres on a project?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. We post links to things that have crossed our
radar &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;anyone seen this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, and either someone has or maybe we
co-ordinate a small scouting party to go test it out and report back.
Cheerleading is also welcome. This is gentle volunteering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Functionally we are surfacing aligned tools, extending our capacity to
sense, progressing common-good, and making friends.

&lt;h2 id="cybernetic-sovereignty">Cybernetic Sovereignty
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not sure how many are familiar with
&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics#Key_concepts_and_theories" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cybernetics&lt;/a>.
As a primer for those who things it&amp;rsquo;s just about cyborgs:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The central theme in cybernetics is feedback. Feedback is a process where the
observed outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways
that support the pursuit, maintenance, or disruption of particular
conditions, forming a circular causal relationship.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in the feedback loops present in our information systems.
In the above sections you see me externalising and collectivising large parts
of my memory, sense-making, and future dreaming. Concretely, Signal is now a
core part of my cybernetic feedback loop &amp;ndash; I take actions which effect a system,
and then I sense the reaction(s) of that system, which stimulated further actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Signal, because the accessibility and activation cost is very low, and
because Signal give a shit about privacy/ security. I would have to be in a bad
place to be doing this on a platform that reads the content (see Meta, Google),
or in any way shapes my feedback loops. To be crystal clear, feedback
manipulation you should watch for is any place algorithms are being tuned to
decide the relevance your posts/ events&amp;hellip; based on the advertising goals or
political agendas of the host corporation. DEI no longer in vogue? How do you
feel about you your discourse and event organising being tuned down, gradually
disappeared?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Signal is great, I am not happy about how fragile Signal is to
disruption. It&amp;rsquo;s feasible that someone dragging an anchor could cripple New
Zealand&amp;rsquo;s internet, severing me from my communities (and exobrain). If there
was a fantastic p2p replacement that had the right security trade-offs,
and accessible UX, I would jump.&lt;/p>

goblins. As our kids grew we had nick-names for them and some of these evolved
into a developmental progression of goblin-ness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the phases I have mapped so far :
&lt;br />&lt;/p>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 1. 🥔 Potato&lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>When humans are born&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re kinda par-baked compared to other animals, as
in they&amp;rsquo;re not ambulatory, and only just aware of their environment. Some
people talk about this as the &amp;ldquo;fourth trimester&amp;rdquo;. Somewhat uncharitably I call
this phase the Potato.&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 2. 👶 Chublin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Your goblin is somewhat active and has started looking a little rolley. They&amp;rsquo;ve
got creases part way down their limbs, big cheeks, and very little neck to
speak of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chubby goblin → Chublin.&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 3. 💩 Grublin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Your goblin has moved on to solids. They make a significantly larger mess
consuming food, and their output is a new level of nasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grubby goblin → Grublin&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2>4. 👹 Grumplin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Your grublin is growing a lot (which hurts) and they&amp;rsquo;ve also developed enough
theory of mind to realise they can say &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo;, and just straight up defy your
requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grumpy goblin → Grumplin&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 5. 👺 Squablin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Higher cognitive functions are online, your goblin can now make reasoned
attacks on your authority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Squabling goblin → Squablin&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>

it really useful wherever there is high variability / unknowns in coordination.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planning-with-kids-chaos">Planning with &lt;del>kids&lt;/del> &lt;em>chaos&lt;/em>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When I had kids, organising hang-outs went from pretty simple to something much
more unstable. For example &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s meet at the zoo at 2pm&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; sounds easy
enough, but then toddlers don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily sleep on an exact schedule, and
there is a greater than zero chance someone could spew in the car on the way
there. Multiply these unknowns by the number of participants and it can be
pretty easy for plans to only semi-align, or totally bomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can generate feelings that range from &lt;em>mild stess&lt;/em> (am I waiting for X to
arrive before we go into the zoo?) through to &lt;em>total bummer&lt;/em> (I was really
looking forward to an adult conversation). A particularly painful failure mode
is the &amp;ldquo;after bedtime han-gout&amp;rdquo; where no children are present (read: &lt;strong>this is
my time off&lt;/strong>), where some kid need arises, you are wrenched back into duty, and
your plans are cancelled. Deep expectation-reality whiplash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your plans involved other people with limited resources, you&amp;rsquo;re probably
also carrying the cost to the group in mind e.g. their expectation-reality
whiplash, and the cost of having the try to re-schedule a hang out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="decomposing-the-problem">Decomposing the problem
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I noticed the crux of the pain for me was the sharp divergence of reality from
expectation. Why was this happening? I think because my internal narrative was
too binary, that is only had two modes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hangin out&lt;/code> ⇒ &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>no hangs&lt;/code> ⇒ &amp;#x1f62d;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What if we told a story which was more nuanced&amp;hellip; reduce the surprise of the
flip between these states. Could we take in all the variables, name and
acknowledged the uncertainty, and build our story on that? Sounds like it might
be too complex, but you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this pattern before ⇒ weather forecasts!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started experimenting with a friend I play
&lt;a class="link" href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/peach?view=spoiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Magic&lt;/a> with. Our
conversations shifted from being more of a roller-coaster:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : How are things looking for a game tonight? &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : &amp;#x1f44d; Yeah I&amp;rsquo;m on! See you at 8pm &lt;br />
&amp;hellip; &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : 😕 you coming? &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : 👀 yep, just running a little late&amp;hellip; &lt;br />
&amp;hellip; &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : 😔 Look I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry, I gotta cancel, child spewing&lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : 😭 oh no! good luck&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To a really smooth expectation ride:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : How are things looking for a game tonight? &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : ☔ 30%, my youngest has a cold, stay tuned! &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : ❤️‍🩹 No pressure this end&lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : ✨ Let me know if the stars align! Otherwise catch you another night&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="updated-forecast">Updated forecast
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the joys of this is that just like a weather forecast, your forecast of
the likelihood of a date working out can evolve over time:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⛈️ 40% we have quite a few &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons" >lemons&lt;/a> on deck&lt;/li>
&lt;li>☁️ 60% grandma said she can take a kid!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>☀️ 85% sick child is asleep 🙌🤞&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want you can front-load a little context about the lemons (complexity/
challenges) that are introducing uncertainty, then subsequent updates can be really
brief, even just &amp;ldquo;20%&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrast this with trying to protect people from complexity (not wanting to
prematurely complicate or worry), but then feeling pressure to offer apologies,
AND explanation, AND &lt;strong>in the exact moment of some disaster unfolding&lt;/strong> &amp;#x1f44e;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="commitment--context">Commitment + Context
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One thing I immediately noticed was that communicating this way separated our
commitment to the relationship from the challenges of our context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I feel like generally people wanted to make a plan work &amp;ndash; to honour
the organising + time people have contributed, the relationship &amp;ndash; and that to
cancel plans felt like some damage that needed acknowledgement and repair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I it&amp;rsquo;s really easy for me to say:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f; I would love to hang out with you! (commitment)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>⛈️ 60%, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m working with (context)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>My commitment + context can now be expressed orthogonally 🤓. It feels like it
unlocks a lot more compassion / kindness, which is especially helpful for anyone
navigating relationships intersecting with complexity, be that kids, mental
health challenges, disability etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lemons 🍋🍋🍋</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Lemons 🍋🍋🍋" />&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally published on Scuttlebutt in 2018.

updated learnings.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was a teacher I worked with this guy Pete Brailsford, who taught
mountaineering. He&amp;rsquo;d take students up into the snow and build snow caves to
sleep in overnight, cross rivers, stuff like that. A major part of the learning
in that context was about &lt;em>managing risks&lt;/em>. The idea is that you can&amp;rsquo;t control
everything, but you can keep an eye on the probability field you&amp;rsquo;re standing
in.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He talked about it like a slot machine - those ones where you pull the handle
and then the options spin and then they lock in like:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="cherries-lemon-cherries-cherries-green_apple">&amp;#x1f352; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f352; &amp;#x1f352; &amp;#x1f34f;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Normally if you get all cherries or something, it&amp;rsquo;s a jackpot, but in this
story, if you get a row of lemons, that&amp;rsquo;s bad, like &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;you got hypothermia and
no-one knows where you are&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you can&amp;rsquo;t control all the slots, but you can watch where you&amp;rsquo;re at. Say you
set out on our adventure, the slots are spinning, and you know what, someone in
our group forgot their jacket &lt;em>BOOM&lt;/em> the first slot just came up&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lemon-white_large_square-white_large_square-white_large_square-white_large_square">&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Ok it&amp;rsquo;s a lemon, but no big deal, it&amp;rsquo;s sunny as. You stop and have lunch,
there&amp;rsquo;s some clouds on the horizon, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>so warm&lt;/em>. Guess what you just
missed a hint, and as you continue to walk it starts to rain and a wind picks
up (being a small island in a massive ocean, weather can change &lt;em>very&lt;/em> quickly
in nz) &amp;hellip; now you&amp;rsquo;ve got 2 lemons&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lemon-lemon-white_large_square-white_large_square-white_large_square">&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Again this is not that big a deal&amp;hellip; except you already have that 1 lemon, so
now you&amp;rsquo;ve got someone in your group who&amp;rsquo;s getting cold. I guess you can see the
trend. Any one of these things is no big deal, but a series of little
misfortunes have a &lt;em>cumulative&lt;/em> effect in terms of the odds you&amp;rsquo;re playing
with. So if you&amp;rsquo;re in this position&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lemon-lemon-lemon-lemon-white_large_square">&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x2b1c;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re now playing a very high stakes games, where one more little lemon, like a
sprained ankle can tip you over into disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-manage-lemons">How to manage lemons
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Lemons aren&amp;rsquo;t always avoidable, but you can often plan ahead and consider what
the odds of lemons are based on different paths. Further, you can reflect as
situtations evolve, asking yourself:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How many lemons are we currently at?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Just having this self-reflective question in your toolbelt can change how you
think and see. It can be really hard to spot them because they can often be
innocuous in the context where they first present &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>in concert&lt;/em>
that the the real trouble manifests. Asking this question out loud to yourself
and your questing party can help you spot more of them early, as well as
increase the liklihood you&amp;rsquo;ll keep them in working memory (most humans suck at
remembering many small factors).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you spot yourself crossing 3-4 lemons, you should probably be starting to
significantly re-asses your plans. Things like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>abort&lt;/strong>: ask yourself if your initial plan is still safe&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>simplify&lt;/strong>: consider cutting non-vital parts of your plan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>alert&lt;/strong>: increase new-lemon vigilance, prepare to escalate responses faster&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="but-mix-im-not-a-mountaineer">But mix, I&amp;rsquo;m not a mountaineer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is relevant to anyone on any adventure (solo, or as a team). You could be
voyaging into literal mountains, or sailing to Great Barrier Island, or you could
be a distributed team building FOSS tools on a limited / no budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some lemons that have fucked up quests I&amp;rsquo;ve been on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>having no retrospectives (process for iterating, adaptation)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>just trusting that everyone remembers the agreement we made &lt;em>(contracts, pay,
expectations)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>forgetting to ask how people are feeling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;figuring it out later&amp;rdquo; for on-boarding / off-boarding / holidays / sick leave&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not telling each other vital quest-changing info &lt;em>(assuming mind-reading or
avoiding conflict)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being unclear on who&amp;rsquo;s doing what&lt;/li>
&lt;li>using too many different tools for communication / coordination&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being unclear about ownership / responsibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>saying &amp;ldquo;this is a flat structure, everyone is equal&amp;rdquo; (but not actually doing
anything to actively distribute power)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>forgetting to account for how disruptive travel can be&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sometimes the course you take has known lemons. Like it&amp;rsquo;s hard to set up
&lt;em>holiday pay&lt;/em> processes when you&amp;rsquo;re a small company and you know everyone and
you&amp;rsquo;re doing it for love and there are so many things to do. You just need to
acknowledge (and remember) that you&amp;rsquo;re carrying a lemon, and if you then try to
onboard someone new, you need to adjust your plan by either stopping to build
that missing stuff (unloading the lemon), or communicating to the new person
clearly about the known lemon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lemons-in-family-systems">Lemons in family systems
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>UPDATE: &lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;ve added this section because it&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;ve most used this
personally, and why I reference this pattern so often.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I say &amp;ldquo;family system&amp;rdquo;, I mean any group of people very strongly committed
to supporting one another, such that the wellbeing of any one person in the
system &lt;em>strongly&lt;/em> effects the wellbeing of the system as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples of family systems I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that this is relevant for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>parent(s) with kid(s)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>partners where at least one has a disability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>partners where at least one has mental health challenges&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You know if you&amp;rsquo;re in such a family system when e.g. one of you gets sick, and
the experience is like &lt;em>the family is sick&lt;/em>. The arc of recovery is often slower
too, because of the complex interactions involved in one person getting taken
out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="noticing-lemons">Noticing lemons
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t track lemons all the time in our family. Lemons in themselves are not
bad &amp;hellip; unattended compounding lemons tend towards disaster though. Typically we
start engaging this pattern when we notice ourselves generally &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>unreasonably&lt;/em> stressed&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>a bit&lt;/em> overwhelmed&amp;rdquo;, or even just &amp;ldquo;unproductive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step is to &lt;strong>pause&lt;/strong> and name the lemons we can spot. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit
overwhelmed today, so here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; work &amp;ndash; my work is in transition, lots of uncertainty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; community &amp;ndash; my school picnic got quagmired, lots of painful learning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; health &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve had a low level cold for 2 weeks, have had a few nights
of bad sleep&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Okeee, so we&amp;rsquo;re at 3 lemons already, and that&amp;rsquo;s only counting the complexities
I&amp;rsquo;m holding&amp;hellip; No wonder I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit overwhelmed!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="compassion">Compassion
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Even noticing that you&amp;rsquo;ve carrying a bunch of lemons can be transformative. My
first step is usually to laugh a little, and feel a little bit of relief &amp;ndash; &lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m
not useless, we have a lot on!&lt;/em> &amp;#x1f605;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having some compassion for ourselves can immediately unload shame / guilt /
pressure, which is &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> strategic, because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you just cut a meta-lemon (wasting brain cycles beating yourself up)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you likely have less of a white-knuckle death-grip on your initial plans,
making it easier to adapt to your actual reality&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="complexity-capacity-lemon-spoon">Complexity capacity &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f944;
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Another pattern we use in our family is &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Spoon
Theory&lt;/a>. The core idea is that if
you&amp;rsquo;re living with some disability you may have very limited capacity, and that
we could model how much capacity people have with units of capacity, spoons
&amp;#x1f944; say. A person with very limited capacity might start the day with 8
spoons, and then have to ration their spoons over the day e.g. shower costs 1
spoon, commute to work costs 2 spoons etc). If you run out of spoons&amp;hellip; maybe
you cannot get home, maybe you can but end up in massive spoon-debt (goodbye
tmrw).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expanding spoons from the individual (to collective capacity) and blending in
the lemons pattern, we can start to say things like &amp;ldquo;today we only have capacity
for 2 lemons&amp;rdquo;. Lemons here represent complexity which will incur spoons
(capacity) cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feels kind because it acknowledges our current capacity, and helps us bound
expectations of how much complexity we can perhaps carry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concretely, while going to a kids birthday in the morning followed by a friends bbq
in the afternoon may seem easy, if we only have 4 spoons, and
this plan takes us to 0 spoon exactly&amp;hellip; that leaves no capacity for unforeseen
lemons, which world put us in spoon deficit. Better to plan one just the one
activity and have spare capacity for curveballs and still be within safe
operating bounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This concept is also useful in the context of startups. Startups are typically
operating with very limited resources (spoons). Basic operations cost capacity
(spoons), and innovation tends to cost in unforeseen complexity (lemons). To that
end it&amp;rsquo;s important not to innovate on too many fronts simultaneously. Examples of
things which incur complexity cost:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; legal structures - e.g. coop, foundation + for-profit symbiosis, &amp;hellip;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; novel technologies - e.g. encrypted replicatable database&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; ethical investment mechanisms - e.g. non-voting shares, redeemable preference shares, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; world-spanning teams - e.g. NZ, EU, USA&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="about">About
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Entropy has been a few things over it&amp;rsquo;s lifetime. At the time I worked on it it
was a distributed signing service, which would form foundational infrastructure
for many automated processes. In essence a new sort of coordination and
financial tooling.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core proposition was&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>users can set up &amp;ldquo;accounts&amp;rdquo; which have configuration held on a global
blockchain. This includes
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>who may initiate signatures for this account?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>what data are they allowed to sign (e.g. raw binary? Transactions &amp;lt; 0.5 ETH?)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>any user may request a signature on some data, and if the user + data pass
validation, then the network initiates distributed threshold signing, and a
signature is returned.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="relationship">Relationship
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I met Entropy through a &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/protozoa" >coop&lt;/a> member who had been working with
them for more than a year. Turns out there were a bunch of p2p friends also
working there &amp;ndash; 2 from &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/dark-crystal" >Dark Crystal&lt;/a>, 1 from
&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/scuttlebutt" >Scuttlebutt&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>⏳ 2024 &amp;ndash; ongoing &lt;br />&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="about">About
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Mātou (&amp;ldquo;we are&amp;rdquo;) is a collective that exists to grow the digital infrastructure
needed to support transformational growth for Māori communities. Māori already
have centuries of experience in collective governance of shared resources and
distributed governance. The problem is that most &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; organisational tools
on offer are reflections of colonial patterns. See &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Conway&amp;rsquo;s
Law&lt;/a> :&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which
are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.&lt;/em>
— Melvin E. Conway&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In Aotearoa (New Zealand), this means that Māori are currently struggling to
organise collectively (as is their tradition) because most of the tools are
fundamentally propertarian/ individualist/ overly top-down&amp;hellip; in short, do not
serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core observation of &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/ahau" >Āhau&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;) was that we must start by
rebuilding right tools starting with &lt;strong>identity&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; this is the foundation by
which we know ourselves (through our history, our relationships), and from here
move into coordinating and building new things. Crucially, this &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> be
rooted in absolute sovereignty (no rented domain names, no foreign servers
controlling authorship, no singular source of truth).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a radical exploration of data-sovereign identity Āhau succeeded in part, but
ultimately surfaced challenges blocking our grand vision:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>identity tools must be &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong>&amp;hellip; but maintaining them with grants is
unsustainable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>each community has it&amp;rsquo;s own tikanga (cultural practice), and we cannot (and
should not) build for all of them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limited Liability Company governing an identity commons is a misalignment with
our &lt;a class="link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=kaupapa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>kaupapa&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mātou is being designed to be a multi-stakeholder entity which gives community
real say in the systems being built, fosters ecosystems, acknowledges and
rewards participation, growing wealth for all. Currently we are coordinating
through &lt;a class="link" href="https://opencollective.com/matoucollective" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Open Collective&lt;/a> (with the
NZ based &lt;a class="link" href="https://thegifttrust.org.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Gift Trust&lt;/a> as a fiscal host), which
lets us work transparently under a charity umbrella.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some projects we&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in recently::&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Supporting the &lt;a class="link" href="https://whangaroapapahapu.org.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Whangaroa Papa Hapū&lt;/a> towards

tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>R+D on the fusion of millennia of Indigenous collective organising patterns

&lt;p>Decent Social was a 24 hour rolling conference that spanned 3 timezones
(Asia-Pacific, Africa-Europe, and Americas). We (the organising team) put a lot
of work in making the event accessible, and safe for participants. I was the
regional host for Asia-Pacific, and on call for any moderation or Code of

&lt;h2 id="about">About
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Āhau is an desktop + phone application for creating collaborative family trees,
and the archiving of records which are linked to that family (photos, videos,
documents).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Te Ao Māori, relationships with family (and land) form the foundation from
which all identity, sense making, and coordination flow. Āhau was designed to
help strengthen this foundation, and be infrastructure that was held by the
people &amp;ndash; identity is precious taonga (treasure) after all.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make self-hosting accessible, Āhau was built on top of a peer-2-peer system
called &lt;a class="link" href="https://scuttlebutt.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scuttlebutt&lt;/a>. This put data in community hands
(not the company&amp;rsquo;s), and the distributed nature meant any servers were just
light-weight relays which anyone in a family could run from home on a computer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>This article was first published on Scuttlebutt, republished here
with a couple edits.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-you-mean-warding">What do you mean &lt;em>warding&lt;/em>?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the context of magic, a ward is a charm or enchantment, usually cast on a
place and set up to bar evil from entering, while letting the good pass freely.
I’m not sure where I picked this concept up, it’s quite likely playing Magic the
Gathering (which ironically enough is itself a ward).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One time a friend of mine threw a P-party (not the drug, like the letter P).
Being a contratrian who enjoys squirreling out edges cases, I went as a
Pterodactyl. My costume was hastily put together - I made a large cardboard mask
(masks and identity are another fascinating thread, but for another time),
didn’t have time for wings, so put on a suit, and tied a tie to my belt as a
tail. Come monday, my belt still had the tail, and I decided to skip figuring
out the knot and wear it to work (I was a highschool teacher at the time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was motivated by: laziness, enjoying attention, opportunity to
systematically break peoples models of me, and role modeling it being fine to be
a weirdo. I got reactions similar to what you experience if you’ve ever shaved
your head or similar - some people making a big deal of it, some people ignoring
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there were nuances in there which were super instructive. Some people were
super judgey “why are you wearing a tail?” (said with a frown and concern). Wow,
that was an incredibly quick shortcut to learning you’re closed minded! Getting
to skip a bunch of pre-amble and have a conversation about what we really value
in people and society was super great. Or if the context wasn’t right, to just
laugh and walk the fuck away. For some people it surfaced insecurity. The
principle of the school (a 60 year old kinda old fashioned but kindly white
dude) approached me after a meeting one
day and said in an embarassed aside:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Huhuh, Mix I notice there are only two of us wearing ties, and I’m wearing
mine around my neck and you’re wearing yours around your arse&amp;hellip; I can’t
help wondering if you’re mocking me!”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Huhuh, yeah”, I said ambiguously.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I also attracted allies. One of the students who chose me as a mentor wore bunny
slippers everywhere (she was way ahead of me on being a delightful weirdo). At
one time we had a teddybear onsie which people casually wore around. One of my
parents turned up to a meeting - “I was at a fabric store the other day and they
had these fluffly offcuts, and I thought of you”, she said, holding up a furry
strip of fabric. So my tie tail got upgraded to a full on furry tail… why not I
guess?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fucking-with-gender-as-a-ward">Fucking with gender as a ward
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Living in an age where gender roles are really prescriptive really sucks. It’s
been really great to explore what not being what dominant culture might call
manly. What’s it like to be able to be vulnerable, try to understand your
feelings, and integrate that into your relationships? Pretty fucking great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What’s it like to notice that all the mens clothes in a shop are boring, and buy
something ‘made for women’ which you feel great in? Excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friends and I are into really open communication, nail painting, and wearing
whatever. Mikey looks gorgeous in a dress. Here’s me rocking a gold lamé top I
found at my mother in laws place&amp;hellip; I’m giving a talk at a JS conf in New Zealand.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I play Magic the gathering. People have feelings and thoughts about this. Same
about Science Fiction. (Oh boy don’t get me started on talking to people who
enjoy ‘literature’ as higher form of writing and look down on sci-fi)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solarpunk? Are you willing to engage with a genre which is optimistic and not
yet clearly defined?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wear your nerddom like a badge, loudly, with pride. Great asshole detector, and
you’d be surprised how many nerds there are out there lurking.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="magic-mysticism-as-a-ward">Magic/ mysticism as a ward
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>You might have seen some of the language of magic swirling around the
scuttleverse. I deliberatly discuss rituals, which I think of as ‘known
repeatable patterns which invite awareness, and weave bonds amongst us’.
Christian culture may have baked a distrust of ritual into your psyche, which is
pretty funny given how littered with ritual the church is. To be clear,
Thanksgiving, Mothers day, Birthday Parties, Show and tell, Checkin rounds,
Retrospectives are all powerful everyday rituals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BUT, using more pagan language is a great ward, and it’s flavourful and fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other magic to watch out for : #invocation, smudging, crystals, alchemy, sun and
moon apps, wizards (I told Piet’s wedding he was a wizard - which I define as a
socially AND technically talented humyn)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn’t an accident. I find magic really deeply evocative and playful. And a
super effective ward - Zach! has a fantastic story I’d love to invite him to
share about running his Solarpunk Magic gatherings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="invoking-a-warding-strategy">Invoking a warding strategy
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>‘Ward’ might not be a perfect title because it more strongly represents guarding
than welcoming, which is a shame. Nevertheless I am inviting you to cast off and
ignore normative culture and proudly wear your marginalised culture, whatever it
is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By making things which are purple, and have rainbows, by being cute, or nerdy, a
little bit magical, or a little bit dirty because you’re building a boat with
your hands, you’re representing that which you love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If other people don’t think that’s scaleable, GOOD. Scaling is normative
capitalistic mindset and warding against that is a gift. It also means we’ll
spend more time meeting beautiful colourful humans who are curious and care
about others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark Crystal</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/dark-crystal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/dark-crystal/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/dark-crystal/logo.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Dark Crystal" />&lt;h2 id="about">About

Over the past 3 years, friends and I have
been growing and shaping an ecosystem for that purpose — for many, it’s now our
primary way of communicating. It’s built with cryptography and is p2p. The
result is a system with fundamentally different behaviours than the old web.
This is part of a series exploring the sociological and technological
ramifications. I call it “The Medium is the Message: Cypherspace Edition”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking at a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://re-publica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

friend &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.richdecibels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

disintermediation.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This got me wondering how our project
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scuttlebutt&lt;/a>, a decentralised social network, is
any different from other hype. Most pressing was the question, “Can we
guarantee that people will be safe from bullying and abuse?” If we can’t build
a community which is free and open for everyone to participate in — if it’s a
space where some people are sexually harassed, or receive threats of violence —
then we’re wasting our time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our decentralised architecture certainly makes global spamming attacks hard,
and data only flows along lines of trust. But it’s still technically possible
for people to abuse others within our community, particularly if they have a
lot of friends in common. In our history to date, we’ve only had a few
incidents of behaviour and communication that run strongly against the
community culture I want to support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how have we dealt with abuse?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="just-kick-them-out">Just kick them out
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>On corporate platforms like Twitter, Youtube, or Facebook, there’s a single
central organisation with (essentially) a single data storage system. In that
context, it’s easy for the owners of the system to delete content or users — in
fact it’s their prerogative and, some would say, responsibility to do so. Most
platforms have a “report” or “flag” feature which marks content or users for
review/exclusion. This can be good, but also results in endless arguments about
these rulings, since policing and judging fairly is expensive and difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies like Reddit get around some of this overhead by being a platform for
community-moderated ‘subreddits’ (channels for specific topics). Sometimes
Reddit admins will still step in and ‘moderate’ user content, like when &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/26/reddits-ceo-regrets-trolling-trump-supporters-by-secretly-editing-their-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>their
CEO messed with Trump
posts&lt;/a>
, which was simultaneously funny and pretty troubling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a federated network, &lt;a class="link" href="https://mastodon.social/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mastodon&lt;/a> takes this a
step further — communities self-host their own ‘instances’ of the platform,
meaning there are many self-governing fiefdoms. Each sets their own rules and
can kick content and people off their instance. It’s great because there’s no
corporation shaping your experience, and you don’t need one policy to cover all
the people in the world. The challenge is you have to be fairly organised as a
group to set up and pay for the infrastructure, and to actively govern your
space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scuttlebutt goes even further: it’s fully decentralised, with no single central
organisation or federation of fiefs. There are only fully autonomous peers,
each running the software on their local computer and making their own choices
about how they want to interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>There is no owner of any shared physical space or hardware from which you
can kick a person&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the double edged sword of p2p social networks — it’s a space safe from
authoritarian interference &lt;em>and&lt;/em> it’s harder to assert boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="have-a-strong-culture">Have a strong culture
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As described above, this decentralisation might sound like total anarchy. It
is, but maybe preconceptions have coloured your expectation of how this might
pan out. In practice, what emerges is not that different to other networks —
people migrate toward and away from conversations and people they want to
interact with. We see ‘islands’ or ‘domains’ of community, which might be
distinct, overlapping, or totally disconnected. It’s similar to the dynamics of
Twitter, but while Twitter’s global space leaves it open for witch hunts and
hashtag storms, Scuttlebutt is more localised and stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is culture in such a fragmented space?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I can only talk about the parts of the Scuttleverse I interact with. It’s
filled with open-source programmers, communists, vegans, feminists, sailors,
and mycologists — and not capitalism or trolls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The community space around me has something like emergent governance. When
someone presents rough behaviour, it’s common for one or more people to
intercede and apply some combination of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>polite inquiry and clarifying questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>assertion of what sort of interaction they’d prefer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This costs time and energy, and it’s totally worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As individuals and as a group, we get the opportunity to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>check our assumptions, and (maybe) build connections with new cultures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>clarify our beliefs and who we are&lt;/li>
&lt;li>role model what respectful conversation and good boundary setting looks like&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our conflicts have advanced us individually, and as group we have built
stronger relationships and are more skilled and articulate. I absolutely
believe this is the fundamental and unavoidable work of community, and that
community is integral to any human ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is all really cool and cerebral, but does this stop rape threats?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(Hasn’t happened yet to my knowledge, but it’s a decent question.)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;em>information flows in a peer
network&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="block-them">Block them
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is the feature I’ve just finished building. Applying culture only gets you
so far — it can’t necessarily protect you from a malicious actor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an extreme situation, the things I want you to be able to avoid are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>being contacted by someone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being stalked by someone&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first one is easy to implement — you can just tell the interface to not
show anything new from that person. What I’ve built actually goes further, by
ceasing propagation of that person’s data to friends of yours not already
connected with this person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second part is harder. We’re a p2p network, where messages are &lt;a class="link" href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/gossiping-securely-is-the-new-email-6d706d4cd435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>gossiped
&lt;/a>—
how do you say things publicly and have them not get to that person? You tell
your friends that’s what you want, and they respect your decision!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In programmatic terms, a ‘block’ is just another type of message which is
gossiped. As soon as a peer receives it, their local setup effects the change
and tops passing information about you to the person you’re blocking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a p2p context, being blocked means you have fewer connected peers, because
the number of people gossiping your messages is reduced. Highly abusive
characters might find themselves enjoying just the freedom of their own speech,
alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-medium-is-the-message">&lt;strong>The Medium is the Message&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Marshal McLuhan coined this &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>iconic
phrase&lt;/a>, and I’d
summarise it roughly as, “The physics of your medium determine what is possible
in that medium, and so ultimately the message.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given Scuttlebutt is a cypherspace (a space whose foundational physics is
cryptography), what is the nature of the medium that is different here, and
&lt;em>what is that message?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The underlying cryptography is what makes it possible for people to be totally
autonomous agents in this social network. It affords a level of freedom from
coercion that is probably unprecedented in a digital space. It also removes all
responsibility for governance or custodianship of a space from any particular
entity and devolves it to the level of individuals making choices. So far in
the Scuttleverse, I’ve seen this lead to a lot of personal responsibility and
growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s also fascinating to watch how the lack of dependence on shared hosting
infrastructure means that we can have a multiplicity of overlapping
communities. A recent example was when I found a user, who calls themselves
Johnny Null, in the &lt;em>#dads&lt;/em> channel (which I started because I’m going to be a
dad soon, and wanted to talk about that with other crypto-dads). I was
surprised, because I had experienced a lot of antagonistic threads with this
person, leading to some of my friends blocking him, but I hadn’t yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this new context, I wasn’t seeing unproductive abuse from him. We found
another way to connect on a really human topic. I was surprised to learn he was
a dad, and to receive encouragement and offers of support from him. It was such
a sharp contrast from previous interactions. The diversity of approaches
available made it possible for some people to block him, but he wasn’t banned
from the network, leaving open new possibilities. I don’t know where that will
go … but perhaps we could still have a chance at understanding each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I see alignment of the physics of p2p space and the physics of everyday
in-person space. It feels poetic that the way we’ve implemented a block in
Scuttlebutt is through communicating boundaries and asking our peers to respect
them. That’s how it works in offline spaces, too. I see this pattern a lot in
what we’re building — p2p interactions mirroring human interaction — and it’s
the heart of what I want to communicate by invoking The Medium is the Message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building systems with peers means the tools we build might be just a little
more human, and make space for adaptive communities. My hope is that this space
will help us re-learn some of what we’ve forgotten in society, and that maybe
this will make a difference in the rising challenges we have to face.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Co-op source</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/co-op-source/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/co-op-source/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/co-op-source/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Co-op source" />&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.protozoa.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Protozoa&lt;/a> is a tech coop, and we write open source code.
This is a little bit about what that means, and how open source is the foundation on which we&amp;rsquo;re building an aspirational future.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently published a new feauture for &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Patchbay&lt;/a> - an open source project I maintain.
It allows you to easily @-mention people in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>scuttleverse&lt;/a>.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward because it&amp;rsquo;s a decentralised space where identity is subjective - many people have more than one use-name. (I gave &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K18XssVBg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a whole talk on subjectiviy here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I mention Mikey by a name that people in our coding context will be familiar with (dinosaur).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why is this significant?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this feature, but the more important parts of this story are the open source and the cooperative culture making this possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="open-source">Open source
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the next couple of days, I&amp;rsquo;m going to generalise this code into a &lt;em>module&lt;/em> called &lt;code>patch-mentions&lt;/code>.
Then I&amp;rsquo;m going to propose changes to Patchbay, and a sister project called &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Patchwork&lt;/a> so that they use use this new module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way everyone gets the new functionality, and when we find bugs in what I&amp;rsquo;ve done, we&amp;rsquo;ll all benefit from the solution.
I&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to use this in subsequent contracting work - a massive speed and reliability boost for myself and for clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I&amp;rsquo;ve actually already done this with a couple of other modules &lt;code>patch-profile&lt;/code> (an easy profile editor) and &lt;code>patch-settings&lt;/code> (which manages client preference settings).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re talking to a programmer about what excites them about open source, this is probably the heart of it.
Every time someone generously shares their work, we save hours / days / weeks of work, and are able to channel these savings into things that matter - like making more accessible interfaces, or building a feature to flag abusive actors (next on my todo list).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooperatives">Cooperatives
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Protozoa is a worker owner cooperative.
While I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, Piet and Dominic are hard at work on different things - contract work, and forming collaborations with other decentralised projects (we&amp;rsquo;re currently crushing on the &lt;a class="link" href="https://economicspace.agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Economic Space Agency&lt;/a> a bit).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For us, contributing to the commons is an important part of our work - it makes all our future work better, and helps build working relationships with other excellent humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of that:&lt;/p>

We met them through the scuttleverse and this is a calendar invite to a catchup planning more work in the future.
By working together, we&amp;rsquo;re able to work on bigger and more exciting projects with the confidence that we can expand to support each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cal invite here is another tool we built is called &lt;code>gatherings&lt;/code>.
It&amp;rsquo;s a module Piet and I made to enable more community interaction.
Other gatherings I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the past week in include &amp;ldquo;Art~Hack Wellington: decommidify your creativity&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Westhaven Car Boot sale&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Bad Ukulele Club&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels amazing to have been able to support more connections between people, and to be doing business in a values aligned space - I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know TableFlip&amp;rsquo;s email addresses&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>⏳ 2015 &amp;ndash; 2017 &lt;br />&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My experience of the potential of what education &lt;em>can&lt;/em> be through working at
&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited" >Unlimited&lt;/a> radicalised me to the point where I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I
would ever work in an educational institution again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="precursor">Precursor
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After leaving teaching for the first time, I went to art school, and happened to
come into contact with some nerds also hacking on community in a different way
(&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.enspiral.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Enspiral&lt;/a>). As a summer experiment, Josh Vial
mentored a group of people in how to code. (This may have been the &lt;em>alpha&lt;/em>
cohort foreshadowing Dev Academy.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left art school, joined &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/loomio" >Loomio&lt;/a>, and extended my radical (i.e.
anarchist) teaching skills into the space of collective organising,
facilitation, and agile development. I did a range of contracts through a
collective called CraftWorks (also part of Enspiral).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="teaching-programming">Teaching Programming
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Having validated an opportunity for a different sort of tertiary eduction around
programming, Josh Vial and Rohan Wakefield launched Dev Academy. The format was
something like a remote prep course, follow by a 9-week long in person
intensive course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was invited to do mentoring for the early cohorts, and ultimately moved into
full time teaching. The teaching team in our era ran somewhat autonomously - we
created and evolved curriculum, hired our own staff, and coordinated with the
rest of the organisation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Teaching&amp;rdquo; at Dev Academy was similar and different to Unlimited. Everyone on
the course had explicitly chosen and opted in to this very specific pathway.
It was incredibly intense - the amount of ground we covered over 9 weeks was&amp;hellip;
quite like being thrown in the deep end, relentless. However we coupled the
technicalities of the conceptual code learning with an strong structure of
personal support - teaching personal reflection, interpersonal communication
tools, and providing close mentoring and counselling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; once again seeing the humans holistically, treating learning as a deeply
personal journey (not just an exercise in content) - of relationship with
yourself and with others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="legacy">Legacy
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It was at Dev Academy that I met Piet Geursen. We formed and enduring
relationship through teaching and leading together, and went on to found
a cooperative together - &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/protozoa" >Protozoa&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m a coder with a background in maths - I excel at
taking ideas and problems apart. The blessing of this is that I understand
systems I work with intimately, perhaps even better than others. The curse is
that some-times my deep-analysis mode presents like &amp;ldquo;pointing out all the
problems&amp;rdquo;; a nay-sayer; a devils-advocate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you relate to any of things, welcome, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this for you - you have a
Black Hat. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because having a Black Hat is a super-power, and if
you&amp;rsquo;ve got one you&amp;rsquo;re probably deploying it sub-optimally. Here are a couple of
easy tweaks to get the most out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="know-when-to-use-it-and-keep-your-friends">Know when to use it (and keep your friends!)
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the context of collaboration, I&amp;rsquo;m fantastic at reviewing, seeing
vulnerabilities, and threats. Historically, I&amp;rsquo;ve also generated a lot of
pushback for quashing fledgling ideas, or &amp;lsquo;always seeing the negative&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>de Bono&amp;rsquo;s thinking
hats&lt;/a>, has been a real
help for me. There are six of them, each representing a different style - or
mode - of thinking, de Bono proposed was that a lot of tension in a groups
emerges from different people being in different modes. (In computer security,
there are also &amp;lsquo;hats&amp;rsquo;, try the post-script for a mapping between the colours)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example in a visioning session, I deploy the Black Hat (critical thinking),
because it&amp;rsquo;s a strength of mine. Meanwhile others in the team are wearing the
Green Hat (generative, exploratory thinking). The combination feels bad,
because most people know that things being suggested aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect - that&amp;rsquo;s
not the point of the exercise at this point - but I&amp;rsquo;m doing the opposite of
creating, I&amp;rsquo;m bringing nothing to the table, I&amp;rsquo;m just cracking the things other
things are bringing open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m just leaning on my strengths - this is a common and
lazy habit of Black Hats. If you notice yourself being called a devils
advocate, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably fallen into this trap. Generally people don&amp;rsquo;t like
devils advocates and if you persist you&amp;rsquo;re in for a bad time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t use your hat, just know when to use it - check in
with your group about what &amp;lsquo;mode&amp;rsquo; we&amp;rsquo;re wanting to be in. If we&amp;rsquo;re doing
exploring, lets agree to be Green Hat, and then agree when we&amp;rsquo;re ready to shift
to stress testing the new ideas all at once (with our Black hats).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-be-think-critically-and-generatively">How to be think critically AND generatively
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is what I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about. It&amp;rsquo;s the realisation that you can use you
Black Hat to spot threats or weaknesses, and then put on a Yellow Hat. If the
Black Hat is the destructive critical thinking, the Yellow hat is the
future-facing critical thinking about our values. (This might not have been de
Bono&amp;rsquo;s intention, but bear with me.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, I&amp;rsquo;m currently teaching a group of coders at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.devacademy.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dev
Academy&lt;/a>. There&amp;rsquo;s this dynamic emerging where 3
of my students are excellent at asking questions. I noticed I was feeling
annoyed, and my Black Hat says &amp;ldquo;These students are dominating the air-space, to
the exclusion of the quieter students, and to the exclusion of the women in the
group&amp;rdquo;. It goes on &amp;ldquo;There are gender and societal dynamics at play here, I
wonder in what ways I could be contributing to this?&amp;rdquo;. The solution that comes
from this hats thinking is &amp;ldquo;You need to tell them to stop asking questions and
tell them we&amp;rsquo;re making the gender gap worse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this is kinda the desired outcome and there is truth in it, it lacks
compassion, and sure as hell isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be received well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By pivoting into my Yellow Hat, I&amp;rsquo;m able to ask the critical question &amp;ldquo;In what
ways is falling short of the desired values I want us to be living?&amp;rdquo; Which
leads to the subtle shift in focus &amp;ldquo;What are the values I want to be living
here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is easy and I kind of already knew it but it was tangled up in my
Black Hat deficit thinking. Clearly resolving &amp;ldquo;I want everyone to be practising
confident question asking, so they can be well equipped for their career.&amp;rdquo;
meant resolving the situation was a piece of cake. I invited the confident 3 to
a conversation, told them the value I wanted to realise, and invited them to
help me.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong> - applying critical thinking to underlying values (as well as the
problem) will help you see and communicate more clearly.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The difference between this solution and the Black Hat-only one is that it has
baked into it the aspirational end state. If others don&amp;rsquo;t agree with that
aspiration, that&amp;rsquo;s a fricken fantastic thing to talk about - you&amp;rsquo;re going to
skip out a bunch of painful mis-alignment.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Most of this learning was possible because of the incredibly supportive and nourishing atmosphere the Enspiral network is growing. Particular families I&amp;rsquo;ve had the priveldge of learning with / alongside are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.loomio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Like being alert
for musky over-ripeness somewhere in your fridge, or unwanted acridity of
burning plastic coming from your computer, smells hint that nearby, something
is amiss, and it’s probably going to get worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In code it’s usually that you’ve used a pattern that seemed good when you
started, but as you continue to add things, suddenly it gets volatile. An
everyday example would be running too many appliances off a multi-board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patterns of coding that lead to future instability we call anti-patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code smells are the whiffs that help us notice anti-patterns. Naming them helps
us spot vulnerabilities, avert catastrophes, and support an evolving discourse
about best (and worst) practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>My flatmate just came back from a conference where she was pulling her hair out
because the way the group was working together was counter-productive. It
occurred to me that it would be useful to port anti-patterns into the
group-work context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to know what group-smells are. Here’s a few we were able to name in my
lounge just now:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cargo-cult-collaboration">Cargo-cult collaboration
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A variant of Richard Feynman’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cargo-cult
science&lt;/a>, this is
implementation of collaboration through shallow adoption of whatever latest
buzzword.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A classic example you might hear is people asserting “we’re a totally flat
self-organised group”. Self-organisation is a thing, but it doesn’t grow just
anywhere. There are certain conditions in which it tends to work well, and many
in which it doesn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some smells to watch out for :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>lack of clarity about where and how decision making is happening&lt;/li>
&lt;li>invitation to ‘be the change’ without any guidance/ support to do that&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no description of what or how self-organisation is going to occur&lt;/li>
&lt;li>founders deny their power and leadership&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not everyone feels empowered to intervene in group processes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The anti-pattern :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you think you’re making space for an ecosystem to magically appear, but you forgot to resource it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Where this anti-pattern can lead :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>invisible power structures which privilege some actors without them being aware of it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>emergent inside / outside groups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>poor communication systems that lead to distrust&lt;/li>
&lt;li>people taking on too many things and burning out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>white men dominating lots of things, women doing administrative roles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Patterns which support self-organisation :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>naming power / leadership roles that exist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>actively sharing roles around&lt;/li>
&lt;li>making decision making processes clear&lt;/li>
&lt;li>clear communication systems&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="talking-over-each-other">Talking over each other
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This one is easy.
In the best case, everyone just cares a lot about the topic of conversation, and they’re excited to share what the conversation is bringing up for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other smells you might notice :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 people having a conversation, while everyone else watches&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anxiety about when you’re going to get to speak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lots of loud people, no quiet people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an old white guy opinion-fest&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The anti-pattern :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you’ve skipped an agreement about how you’re going to approach things, and conversation has defaulted to loudest / most dominant&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Where this anti-pattern can lead :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>less listening&lt;/li>
&lt;li>less diverse opinion &lt;/li>
&lt;li>shallow analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Patterns you might consider that help:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>appoint a facilitator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>introduce a rule (e.g.
talking stick, or you can only talk again after 2 other people have spoken)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>change the format (e.g.
split into smaller groups, get everyone to write thoughts on cards, go for a walking dialogue)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="miscy-meeting">Miscy meeting
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>(pronounced ‘misky’, *misc = miscellaneous,)&lt;/em>
There’s a bunch of you in a room talking about your project and raising
relevant ideas. The conversation energy is good, and you’re discussing all the
things. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a great space for combining ideas, exploring shared values, and
connecting with each other. If you were intending to run a discovery session,
or a workshop, that&amp;rsquo;s great. If you were expecting decisions and action, it
might be worth checking whether you&amp;rsquo;re in a miscy meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might smell:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>no-one recording any actions / agreements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>surprise at the topics being raised (lack of agreement about why you’ve met)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>topic drift / people changing topics annoyingly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>excited exploration of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-rabbit-hole-rabbit-hole" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>rabbit-holes&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no clear ending to meeting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The anti-pattern :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you haven’t agreed on what you’re actually doing, so you’re starting a range of things and doing them poorly or not at all. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Where this anti-pattern can lead :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>massive waste of group time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>frustration when people remember agreements / actions differently in the next meeting &lt;/li>
&lt;li>more miscy meetings, gradual loss of momentum&lt;/li>
&lt;li>inability to unlock &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>continuous improvement&lt;/a> / evolution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Patterns for clearer meetings :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>start by asking ‘what is the purpose of this meeting?’&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use an agenda, and refer back to that when needed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>record agreements / actions (and who is going to do them) and share &lt;/li>
&lt;li>call ‘rabbit hole’ when you smell one&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use some ‘meeting ending’ ritual (e.g.
a checkout-round) so everyone knows when you’re done and don’t auto-extend your meeting ad infinitum&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>These are just a sample of course.
Lets spot anti-patterns together and name them.
Lets spot group-smells and do better work together.
I’d love to hear of any common anti-patterns you’ve already named in your group work, please post them up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Power &amp; Learning</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/power-and-learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/power-and-learning/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/power-and-learning/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Power &amp; Learning" />&lt;p>I value conciseness so here&amp;rsquo;s what I think the essence of it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> Power dynamics hamper learning
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> What a waste of potential
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="my-history">My History
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>There&amp;rsquo;s a chance I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s my story if you want to parse it yourself.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="school">School
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As an inquisitive (and naive) teenager, I judged IT largely by what was offered at school.
Touch typing, some HTML maybe, but none of the really beautiful stuff.
The offering was boring and unchallenging compared to centuries-old maths and sciences.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="university">University
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My inquiry led me to study neuroscience, which turned out to be a bit too
reductionist to practically help me understand people (so western!). I graduated
as a mathematician, and after failing as a post-graduate research assistant
(modelling blood splatter of blunt weapon trauma), I took a government subsidy
to train as a teacher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d really enjoyed tutoring at university, but found that my higher education on
education guided me into surprisingly unsavoury amounts of acting (playing some
authoritarian role) and crowd control (learning tricks to manipulate group
social dynamics to maintain control).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about the length of hair or the height of socks. Quiet (but
noticed) protest looked like attending careers day and meeting prospective
school principals in ripped jeans. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother attending my graduation (NOTE&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>going off piste often requires more paperwork later).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The irony of teaching engaging learning in a lecture format was a laugh, but the
university did introduce me to &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited" >Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery&lt;/a> -
the only high school I would take a job at. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t an act of rebelion, more
an extension of my stubornness and pickiness (which I was rich enough to be able
to afford).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was so attractive about Unlimited was the atmosphere (or people dynamics).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited" >Unlimited&lt;/a> is a state funded public secondary school that exists
because of a loophole in the law, which allowed the bending of a rule meant for
the integration of church schools into a rule which allowed the school to write
its own assessment rules. Its &amp;ldquo;special character&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;a fundamental tenet that
the child is central in directing his or her own learning so that the enthusiasm
and love of learning is retained.&amp;rdquo; My kind of place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can talk a lot about what made that environment transformative, but I think
the key was radically more equal power dynamics. As a Learning Advisor there, I
didn&amp;rsquo;t assert authority through enforcing arbitrary rules. I had conversations
on a first name-basis with people about what they cared about in life. Classes
didn&amp;rsquo;t have age-barriers, and students could choose what they wanted to do every
5 weeks. Instead of segregation and age-based hierarchy, there was conversation
and experiementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt good. People were kind (not to be confused with nice), and they learnt a
lot. Instead of negotiating bullying and claustrophobia, students spent their
time doing things like attending university level classes, running New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s
only OpenDNS server from a bedroom, and working together to support a friend
with depression. Some of the experiences moved me so deeply I still cry when I
recall them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most state education is missing the mark by a wide margin. It makes me
thoroughly sad - and angry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="art-school">Art School
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I loved Unlimited, and learnt an enourmous amount there, but I left to stretch
skills outside of teaching. There was also a massive earthquake that destroyed
the city. I moved to attend art school, where I got into programming the laser
cutter (which I was shocked to find almost no one else was using).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was the worst adult student - I know what good education looks like, and I
like giving feedback. The context and tools were great but the educators
(outside of the pure theorists) were weak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left and did some relief teaching where I tried to treat students as equals. I
was horrified to discover that the acting I&amp;rsquo;d disliked in state teaching is a
two part play, and exiting a play is hard when the other actors are continually
asserting your role. Genuine conversation was overridden by a race to establish
dominance and control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="social-enterprise">Social Enterprise
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over a summer break I was introduced to Joshua Vial who taught me (and several
others) to be web developers. I took these skills and helped build Loomio (an
open source collaborative decision-making tool).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.loomio.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Loomio&lt;/a> - and the garden-nebula Enspiral
within which it grew - were the next group of most excellent people I met. This
is where I was introduced more explicitly to a discourse around power.&lt;/p>

coding bootcamp that trains non-technical people to become junior web developers
in 9 weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s a synthesis of my interests to date - programming, learning,
and community building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I take myself, and those around me to and beyond the limit of our technical

&lt;h2 id="power-and-knowledge">Power and Knowledge
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not knowing things for some reason brings up shame for people. The most
dangerous thing for a student is self-doubt, and sitting on shame is a good way
to get that. This is another topic I&amp;rsquo;m currently really interested in, and will
write more on some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that might be a study in itself, but I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in how &lt;em>not
knowing&lt;/em> plays out for teachers, because I believe this is the reason I&amp;rsquo;m not
currently an ascendant cyber-wizard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you don&amp;rsquo;t know a thing as a teacher, a &lt;strong>very interesting&lt;/strong> decision path
emerges:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A) lie&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B) admit you don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-would-you-lie">Why would you lie?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Well, if your position as teacher is predicated on your knowing more, being the
&lt;em>source of truth&lt;/em>, then not knowing might seem to undermine that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The average high-school teacher is in a surprisingly precarious power-position -
it might look like they have control, but only through carefully guided consent
of the class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a teacher in a position where their authority is coupled to their knowledge,
it is awfully appealing to steer conversation away from topics which might erode
that position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this is why classes on computers suck so bad in high school - they are
born of institution, which is established in such as a way as to bind teaching
to the bounds of individual mastery, which is finite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Education around computers offer a unique window into the future of learning.
The field is moving so fast, that &lt;strong>the only reasonable path is to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t
know&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> a lot. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, then talking about new and relevant ideas won&amp;rsquo;t be
part of your curriculum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many educational institutions, saying I don&amp;rsquo;t know is not safe for educators.
Generally they are in systems that give them positional authority to solve the
&amp;lsquo;behaviour management&amp;rsquo; problems. They are generally not afforded humanising
tools of social safety, like building genuine relationships, or sharing
vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does everyone trapped in that dynamic a huge disservice. Both teachers and
students achieve less understanding, less empathy, less collaboration, less
critical thinking, etc. The learning is poorer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="not-knowing-as-power">Not knowing as Power
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Being able to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is the beginning of some fantastic cascading effects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>reveals &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;teachers&amp;rsquo; both as learners&lt;/li>
&lt;li>opportunity to model good learning
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>critical thinking/problem solving (process over rote learning)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>asking for help&lt;/li>
&lt;li>listening&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shows teacher as human, relatable
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>more trust, less lying&lt;/li>
&lt;li>more humanistic dynamic, better conversations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>drop shame, move to a growth mindset&lt;/li>
&lt;li>go beyond boring &amp;lsquo;safe&amp;rsquo; topics
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>interesting, inspiring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>engaging (perhaps people like me 15 years ago)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>play&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is how I see power dynamics hampering our learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m investing in education systems which set aside positional authority, and
foster environments in which it&amp;rsquo;s safe for everyone to be vulnerable. For older
systems, I&amp;rsquo;m building an evolving book format, designed to open education
resources and support teachers to transition from authorities to guides and
catalysts of learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be working in a community which is supporting me to develop a
different sort of learning pattern for myself. Maybe if we&amp;rsquo;re lucky (and
persistent), we can shift learning patterns more broadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to hear from anyone else playing the long game of reshaping
education.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uncapturable Distribution</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/uncapturable-distribution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/uncapturable-distribution/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/uncapturable-distribution/galaxy.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Uncapturable Distribution" />&lt;p>So I hang out with a bunch of big dreaming nerds with a bunch of different
interests, but when we explore what it is we want in our future, it&amp;rsquo;s a happy
thriving civilisation. You&amp;rsquo;ll know we&amp;rsquo;re there because we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking after
each other, curiously exploring, sharing our successes, and making
intergalactic friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshops were about developing a Theory of Change for each group.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Theory of Change&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The process of forming a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Theory of
Change&lt;/a> is about
coming up with a map of how change will come about in the world. It starts by
a group building a shared vision of it&amp;rsquo;s particular desired end-state is.You
then proceed to build a graph of dependent states back from that end point to
the current state of the world. This is called &amp;lsquo;back-casting&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The process has several steps including things like surfacing and testing
assumptions, detailing how you would measure successful change at each step,
and assessing the cost and nature of intervention to prgress between states.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In each of the workshops, 2 hours of conversation made barely a dent in
completing a fully detailed map, but we&amp;rsquo;d revealed a lot of territory. Both
workshops explored similar veins, but here I&amp;rsquo;ll explore the second, because
it&amp;rsquo;s fresher in memory and highly relevant to my current work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-build-a-decentralised-database">Why build a decentralised database?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a workshop I ran with the Secure Scuttlebutt team who all happened to
be in San Francisco recently. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the top of our theory of change
diagram looked like :&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some important things we agreed we need to achieve were :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>specialisation without inequity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rich ecosystem (supports diverse approaches)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore one particular chain of states back. This format makes it
hard to simultaneously discuss the branching and interconnected dependencies,
so please forgive me if the analysis seems to narrow. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this
particular chain because it raised questions which provided a useful frame or
lens for projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on or with. From the top it reads :&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Galactic council&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Large scale social harmony&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Post scarcity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distribution primarily in service of society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distribution is distributed and un-ownable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We build our distribution on un-capturable technologies&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As distribution surfaced as a theme, we tested our assumptions against real-world examples :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>distribution of food and goods: supermarkets, walmart&lt;/li>
&lt;li>distribution of information: email, google, facebook&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We observed that &lt;strong>ownership&lt;/strong> of distribution by &lt;strong>actors mainly interested in
profit&lt;/strong> has lead to problematic dynamics which block us from joining the
Galactic Council. See massive food waste, destruction of diversity through
monopoly, development of tools which optimise addiction and consumption,
development of tools which define value for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="some-examples">Some examples
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of a couple of interesting cases in the context of
information distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[Email]&lt;/strong> : a super successful open protocol. Anyone can send emails to
anyone. The failing of email is that it has no mechanism for dealing with
un-wanted noise (see spam). This has generated a niche for organisations to
offer value (spam filtering), and capture users. For example Gmail is popular
because it does fairly reliable spam filtering. This makes email less open,
because small private servers have a harder time generating a good &amp;rsquo;not-spam&amp;rsquo;
reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Distribution systems must have a solution to noise.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[Facebook]&lt;/strong> : built on an open protocol - http - but has centralised closed
databases, and a closed (proprietary) interface. Facebook&amp;rsquo;s primary motivation
is profit, which inclines it to leverage it&amp;rsquo;s closed-ness (right of refusal of
access) to extract value from it&amp;rsquo;s user-base.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All parts of a distribution system need to be uncapturable - open protocols
are not sufficient&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>facebook ToS&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[Google]&lt;/strong> : the growth of the internet beyond easily navigable scales led to
the birth of search engines. The current winning solution to this problem is an
algorithm which determines site value based on linkages and references. Again,
this is a niche which has been captured by a primarily profit motivated
organisation. This capture looks something like a monopoly through dependence,
and is &lt;a class="link" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/25/search-googles-castle-moat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>defended by a suite of related free and powerful
tools&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Distribution systems need to address capturable searchability&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="things-you-should-consider">Things you should consider
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve named a bunch of assumptions and principles that we think need to be
integrated in order to get us on the road to The Galactic Council.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is your interaction with distribution systems, are you investing in
systems that build the future you want to see?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How do you network online, is it via an actor interested mostly in profit?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who holds power over the definition of value of what you&amp;rsquo;re interacting with?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where do you publish your content?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s overly idealistic to transition immediately to decentralised
uncapturable solutions, but there are small choices that we can and should
start making if we want to live in a thriving society.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.loomio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Loomio&lt;/a> (a collaborative decision-making
platform), we&amp;rsquo;ve addressed some of these same problems by a steadfast
commitment to being &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/loomio/loomio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>open-source&lt;/a>. While
individual instances of the platform may have closed databases, the
open-sourcing of the platform code means that anyone can own and control their
own instance. It also makes advertising and data-mining significantly less
likely, because anyone in the community can fork the code-base and rip anything
extractive out. For Loomio this is actually a selling point - it&amp;rsquo;s a clear
signal that our primary value is in serving society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Loomio, capturing ownership has also been very seriously addressed in how
we&amp;rsquo;ve written our constitution, and our approach to investment. In short, you
can&amp;rsquo;t buy Loomio, and no one person can control it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You might notice this isn&amp;rsquo;t published on medium. Honestly, this is an
experiment in document splicing using a tool I made currently called
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/mixmix/hypermarkdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hypermarkdown&lt;/a>. In retrospect this
approach does tick some boxes. This content is currently being hosted at
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/mixmix/blogposts/blob/master/uncapturable_distribution.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>github.com&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;
which sounds like my content might be captured buuuut, github is acutally built
on a distributed content system called &lt;a class="link" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>git&lt;/a>. An exact
mirror of the data lives on my computer as well, and could easily be hosted by
any git based server, like a self-hosted &lt;a class="link" href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>gitlab&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s still the problem of how it is you&amp;rsquo;ve found your way to this blog.
99.9% liklihood is that in 2015 it was via facebook, or twitter (it probably
wasn&amp;rsquo;t via google because the way I built this accidentally makes it harder to
index).&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s an open and secure decentralised database
where distribution flows along trust lines, as determined by following
(positive value) and flagging (negative value).&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="link" href="www.enspiral.com" >Enspiral&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a open source tool which supports
decision making - specifically timely, iterative, consensus/consent building
process, with a focus on clearly stated (and archival) records of results.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;#x1f4dd; This is reposted from writing on Scuttlebutt. &lt;br />
&amp;#x2139;&amp;#xfe0f; Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti is now &lt;a class="link" href="http://aotawhiti.school.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ao Tawhiti&lt;/a> after the earthquakes&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I enjoyed working as a tutor when I was at uni, so after some sloppy (failed)
post-grad maths research on blood splatter analysis, I decided to try out
teaching. The training was pretty meh, but I wandered into a skype call with
this place called Unlimited (some polytechnic or something?), anyway young
people telling us about producing albums, making video games, managing their own
time and talking like mature adults. Towards the end of the call it turned out
we&amp;rsquo;d been talking to high school students as young as 14. I asked for a placement
there, and after doing practicum in the sort of place where people gave a fuck
about other people and supported actual learning I refused to take a job
anywhere else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I lived in Christchurch for 4 years and, and worked with some wonderful
learning advisors and some amazing young people.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Some communities have a sort of magic that&amp;rsquo;s a little hard to convey. I could
disect the anatomy / physics of this beautiful space (and I think about this a
lot!), but as an introduction I&amp;rsquo;ll instead share a couple stories, because for me it&amp;rsquo;s through interactions that the heart of a system is revealed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="trainee-teacher">Trainee Teacher
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a trainee teacher in a maths class, there&amp;rsquo;s a student swinging on their
chair and looking out the window. Here&amp;rsquo;s the dialogue between the learning
advisor (Duncan) and the student (Hamish)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Duncan&lt;/strong>: Hey Hamish, looks like you&amp;rsquo;re not getting much done&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hamish&lt;/strong> : Nah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this big event coming up this week which I&amp;rsquo;m
thinking about (sport/ music? I can&amp;rsquo;t remember)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Duncan&lt;/strong>: Oh that&amp;rsquo;s cool! What&amp;rsquo;s that about?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;hellip; 5 minutes of genuine conversation about shit that matters in Hamish&amp;rsquo;s life&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Duncan&lt;/strong>: Hey, so it sounds like you&amp;rsquo;ve got a bunch on. If you want to go
have a nap or read a book under that tree, we can catch up on your maths
later. Or if you&amp;rsquo;d like to give the maths a go, we&amp;rsquo;ve got another 15 minutes
left of this class.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Things that stood out clear as day to me :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>no bullshit authoritarianism, i.e. I was expecting &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;DONT swing on your chair,
GET BACK into focus!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> (teacher training taught me that ~ 50% of the job is
coercion / crowd control / acting)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the &amp;lsquo;student&amp;rsquo; was open and honest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it was an even mature conversation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the outcome was awesome, everyone won (was respected, and supporting the
student&amp;rsquo;s learning was 100% nailed)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="real-learning">Real learning
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Later, when I was an Learning Advisor (official role title, re-centres
&amp;ldquo;teachers&amp;rdquo; as supporters, facilitators, mentors), I had a group of students
who&amp;rsquo;d chosen to work with me (mostly nerds). On of them (Harley) was keen to go
skiing.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Harley&lt;/strong>: hey Mix, can we go skiing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong>: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to take you skiing if you figure out all the
logistics and safety and stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Harley&lt;/strong>: &amp;hellip; ok, what do I need to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong>: I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but we could talk to Peter, he does mountaineering
courses and knows how to do risk assessments or whatever&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we went skiing. Responsibility was shared, Harley and friends learnt how to
budget, plan, and coordinate. We did similar things all the time, like making a
~VR headset with wii controllers, and building a RepRap (3d printer&amp;hellip; this one
got interrupted by the quake).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="everyone-is-a-teacher-everyone-is-a-learner">Everyone is a teacher, everyone is a learner
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Every wednesday afternoon the whole school would stop and do some sort of
exercise. The most minimal one was &lt;em>Walking&lt;/em> - we&amp;rsquo;d walk through the CBD and
around the gardens of Hagley Park (Christchurch has a huge central park). My
first time out, I lost like 60% of the students, and was freaking out. When I
got back, my supervising teacher said &amp;ldquo;oh yeah, they&amp;rsquo;ll have just walked home,
it&amp;rsquo;s fine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later I ended up taking kids who wanted to go skateboarding to the skate park. I
didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to skate at the time, and one day one of them said &amp;ldquo;Hey Mix,
you should learn how to drop in on the half-pipe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of me was like &lt;em>NOPE&lt;/em> but the other part of me was like &amp;ldquo;You gotta do this,
it&amp;rsquo;s really important you role model incompetence and perseverance in
learning&amp;rdquo;. So they taught me very kindly and patiently how to skate. After a
month of this, we&amp;rsquo;d built a bunch of trust and the boys were asking what other
classes I took and genuinely sounded open to checking out stuff they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
otherwise have been into. You can grow curiosity. Relationships matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The school had a core mantra: &lt;strong>everyone is a teacher, everyone is a learner&lt;/strong>.
This story kinda sums that up for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Students also taught me to how to &amp;#x1f512; pick locks, &amp;#x1f355; trade Bitcoin for
pizza, &amp;#x1f697; change the oil on my car, etc.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="earthquakes">Earthquakes
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At the time of the quake, I was 2 blocks from the city centre, on my way to a
teachers union meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Major traumatic events do weird things to your perception and memory. I don&amp;rsquo;t
remember how long the quake was (it was 30s to 2 minutes?), but I do remember
thinking I was having some sort of brain breakdown, or drugs, or .. my vision
was fucked. The trees - giant oaks - were melting and waving &amp;hellip; so were the
lamp-posts. When the rolling stopped, I wondered if it had been a bomb. Where
before there was a block of buildings on one side of the park there was a
building sized cloud of dust&amp;hellip;.. it was a totally opaque wall of dust rising
into the sky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, I paused before wondering if I should go back to the school -
maybe fuck everyone else? I figured trying carefully might be ok. By this time
the half dozen teachers I had been walking with, only 2 were still there. I
don&amp;rsquo;t know where everyone went. For sure those with children of their own left
without pause at top speed. As we made our way back towards the school (a 4
storey building on the other side of the city square, 3 blocks away), we passed
people saying things like &amp;ldquo;The Cathedral is down&amp;rdquo;. Not being inclined to
investigate, the 3 of us set out to go the long way round. One of us decided to
cut through an arcade with a glass roof. I chose to take another street. There
wasn&amp;rsquo;t much discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found two of my students in togs (swim-suits) with towels. I told them to put
their shoes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we passed through taller buildings, there were sounds like rubble and glass
falling, and hissing &amp;hellip; like broken water mains, or was it gas? I had a weird
echo of experience playing FPS games &amp;ndash; I knew the rules, it was DO NOT stand
still, keep your head, and keep moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having people to look after helps a lot. As we walked there were people all
walking around on the road. Some were moving quickly, others were consoling
people crying. There were also people just standing and staring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We found a train of students exiting the central city, being guided by teachers
(there were only 4 adults in the school of 400 over the lunch because of the
union meeting). I become a redirection node, like in that classic game
lemmings. I found myself directing adults who were wandering as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ultimately joined the train, and made our way to a nearby park. As we went,
the students in the towels (I think?) asked me &amp;ldquo;are those people ok?&amp;rdquo;. I said I
didn&amp;rsquo;t know, and that we needed to keep moving. I was later told we walked past
people bleeding from injuries, and past bodies being pulled from the rubble. We
also walked passed a film studio where my girlfriends flatmate worked. It was
flat. Of the 4-5 storeys, there was nothing but the stairwell. He died in there,
along with dozens of others. I remember seeing that, and the noxious smoke
coming out of the rubble, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember seeing any dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to the small park (2 small city blocks in size), and started to try to
take stock. I understand more how and why the Romans organised they did (under
standards/flags, with command-tents, and information runners). It was pretty
chaotic. Try organising ~400 people with no spatial physical system. Hierarchy
and layers of responsibility become really valuable. Over time a triage centre
and helipad were set up down one end of the park. I stayed till dark as friends
and family picked up children. We took food from the nearby supermarket I think?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I met up with my girlfriend, we walked through the deserted streets. Down one
street cars were half sunk into the road like the ground was quicksand
(liquefaction).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if my house was still standing. The tunnel to Lyttelton was
closed. The next day, 4 of us decided to risk driving over the hill. We passed a
house that had a hole the size of a truck through the middle where a boulder had
passed straight through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our old wooden flat was fine, but there was no running water for days. We shat
in plastic bags for a bit, but soon dug a shit pit to squat in. There was a huge
tanker of water brought in and parked down in the center of our little town. You
could go get buckets or bottles filled down there. Civilisation gets pretty
intense pretty quick without water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll write about the damage to the social fabric later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-learning">More learning
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I stayed a year (or more?) after the quake. The school was seriously disrupted
(moved half-way across the city, sharing with another school), my relationship
broke up, I did some therapy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in my 20s, and I&amp;rsquo;d just poured 4 years of my life and soul into lifting
up others learning and lives. I wanted to do some of that for myself, so I
decided to move to Wellington and attend Art School.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reflections">Reflections
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I think Unlimited did a great job of wrapping support and guidance around
students. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an environment which worked for everyone. I think if I was
to change one thing given years of perspective, it would be to weave more
collectivism into the spirit of the place &amp;ndash; extend the focus beyond &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s my
learning pathway?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> towards &lt;em>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;what can we achieve together?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlimited forever changed how I see institutions and learning. I was
radicalised&amp;hellip; am now forever an advocate for holistic education, of systems
which embed care. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change a thing about that, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a
heart-breaking burden to bear sometimes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
