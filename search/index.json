[{"content":" Critical Signals explores practical and visionary responses to an era of collapses, with a focus on kai sovereignty, data sovereignty, collective resilience, and adaptation strategies under a rapidly changing climate. With community at the project center, it asks what changes could we make to our infrastructure, food and energy systems to ensure we not just survive, but thrive, in the years ahead.\nThis evolved from last years successful Beautiful Signals. A 3 months long community space hosted in Pōneke / Wellington in partnership with the Goethe Institute, several universities, and many community memebers.\nI built and maintained the website in collaboration with infrastructure by nikau.io.\n","date":"2025-07-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/critical-signals/cover_hu_1ff6a4890822eb81.png","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/critical-signals/","title":"Critical Signals"},{"content":"Origin Child : How come you get to eat icecream on the couch? Mix : Because I have my Icecream Licence!\u0026quot;\nThis was intended as a joke but lead to me outlining the key competencies you have to demonstrate to access this licence:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t spill icecream on the couch If you do, you notice it You know how to clean spills You actually clean those spills As of writing this, my oldest has the licence, my youngest has decided they\u0026rsquo;re not ready for the responsibility yet, and happily eat at the table.\nWhy? I was exhausted by repeat queries, and while \u0026ldquo;because I said so\u0026rdquo; is sometimes appropriate, it\u0026rsquo;s more often a lazy response which doesn\u0026rsquo;t support learning.\nReflections The Icecream Licence was bootstrapped directly off the Drivers Licence. In the case of the car we want people to have agency in their life, and to balance that freedom with the safety of other citizens. In the case of the icecream, I want my kids to relax and have fun, AND I want a harmonious house (one where I\u0026rsquo;m not yelling STICKY FINGERS ARGGHH!!!! nor resentfully sponging dairy out of soft furnishings).\nMy ultimate goal is for my kids to be fully autonomous, self-actualizing, socially integrated humans. There are lot of places freedom is dangerous (to self and/or others). The \u0026ldquo;Licence\u0026rdquo; is a really clear way to support people to grow into that freedom.\nThis is very similar to an education context, which works in \u0026ldquo;qualifications\u0026rdquo;, often defined by \u0026ldquo;key competencies\u0026rdquo; which need to be demonstrated in some way. Qualifications are usually used to boundary access to additional course/ programmes/ jobs. Licences are a sort of qualification which often boundary something dangerous to an individual / group / system.\nQualifications and Licences are both awarded by \u0026ldquo;authorities\u0026rdquo; - entities we\u0026rsquo;ve invested with the right to author, and to authorise (extend authorship/ autonomy). There\u0026rsquo;s a clear power dynamic in here, which needs some attention and care. While I still often hold the ultimate authority, the shift has been towards defining access to power, and supporting my kids to access that safely.\nIt feels great to shift from \u0026ldquo;No, because I said so\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;Yes, when you can demonstrate X,Y,Z, are you ready?\u0026rdquo;\nCreating Licences Not everything should be a Licence. However we\u0026rsquo;ve found it a very succinct way to communicate with our kids: a) There is something adult or dangerous here \u0026#x1f525; b) There is a pathway, I\u0026rsquo;m here to support you \u0026#x2764;\u0026#xfe0f;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some reflective questions to support you explore Licences:\nWhy are you really blocking your child? You\u0026rsquo;ve probably been giving your child \u0026ldquo;some reason(s)\u0026rdquo;, but it\u0026rsquo;s likely truncated because you lacked the time, and your child lacks context. Pause and unpack it more fully. This provides hints about what your child might need to learn / master.\ne.g. icecream isn\u0026rsquo;t directly dangerous, but it can attract animals, breed microbes, damage relationships\nWhat does doing this well look like? You are likely unaware of how many points of context + skills are involved with some domains. Happily, you can probably imagine a lot of ways your child would fail. Use these as pointers to mapping our explicitly the pieces of knowledge and skills required.\nHow do you \u0026ldquo;fail well\u0026rdquo; here? Just because adults \u0026ldquo;know how to do something\u0026rdquo; does not mean they nail it every time. A key aspect of mastery is knowing how to adapt when failure occurs - often this involves sensing failure early, and knowing how to gently correct.\nwhat does this look like when it goes wrong? what are the best options for recovering/ mitigating damage? Could this Licence have levels? How can we practice basics and succeed before adding more context/ complexity/ skills?\ne.g. ice-cream in a bowl, in a cone, with/ without chocolate sauce (see Dangerous Goods Licence)\nLicence revocation? In our house you can definitely lose your Icecream Licence. Sounds kinda punitive perhaps, but we\u0026rsquo;ve found having clear expectations about what\u0026rsquo;s involved with a Licence makes it really easy to outline outcomes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s totally ok to not want to have responsibility for everything all the time! If you want to pause on some of those responsibilities, it just means that some of your freedom/ autonomy may be curtailed. We align power with responsibility \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2025-05-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/icecream-licence/cover_hu_e6b096a341721a7.png","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/icecream-licence/","title":"Icecream Licence"},{"content":"In an earthquake, you need to coordinate with those you love.\nAre you ok? Where are you? Do you have the kids? 23m The cellular network is great, AND you should expect it to be disrupted. Cell towers require a lot of power, and intact data/phone lines. If one goes down, others take on more load, and when everyone is over-loading networks trying to connect, they\u0026rsquo;re even less reliable.\nSo\u0026hellip; what do we do?\nMesh Networks A mesh network is made up of many devices, each of which can talk to it\u0026rsquo;s neighbour. In a mesh network you can get a message across the city by passing it through a series of peers. The good news is there\u0026rsquo;s already an active mesh in Wellington, and joining it will only make communication more resilient.\nImages taken from this Live Map, May 2025.\nSome interesting things to note about this mesh network\nwhat a mess! \u0026ndash; correct, this is mostly an uncoordinated (ad-hoc) network. It evolves over time as nodes move, turn on/ off. Messages just take the paths that are open and it mostly \u0026ldquo;just works\u0026rdquo;. how come some line are real long? \u0026ndash; some devices are on top of mountains, and/ or have special antennas, which means signals can jump further (like the top of the South Island). isn\u0026rsquo;t revealing your location a security risk \u0026ndash; Yes! Not all devices opt into broadcasting their position, i.e. there are likely more devices in the mesh that pictured. I believe you can also choose to have a \u0026ldquo;rough\u0026rdquo; location broadcast so people others can map your neighbourhood, but not your (latitude, longitude) Beginners Recipe Cell phones don\u0026rsquo;t currently have LoRa (long range radio) capability built in, but we can easily add that functionality via a Bluetooth accessory.\nTwo phones message via LoRa devices they are each connected to. This recipe gives you text messaging + GPS location over a mesh network. The battery on the LoRa device should last a couple days, and not take much to charge.\nIngredients I recommend you buy parts for you and a friend - you immediately have someone you can communicate with AND you further strengthen the mesh for the wider community\nHardware Function Cost Smart phone screen + keyboard BYO SenseCAP T1000e LoRa radio $40 USD + shipping The T1000e is the device I\u0026rsquo;m recommending. It works out of the box, requires only a little setup, and there was no command-line hacking. You connect to it via Bluetooth and it takes care of all the LoRa stuff.\nNOTE: you need 1 x T1000e per person\nSoftware Function Meshtastic App messaging app + device config Meshtastic is an open-source project with builds mesh-networks via LoRa devices. It\u0026rsquo;s been designed to work with a range of devices, and lets you configure them via Bluetooth. It is also the main interface by which you message other peers in the network - there is functionality for public messages, private group chat (encrypted), and direct messages (encrypted)\nSetup Install Meshtastic from an app-store Power on your T1000e push the center of the raised circle → \u0026#x1f3b5; Pair your phone turn on Bluetooth open the Meshtastic App go to Config \u0026#x2699;\u0026#xfe0f; tab (far-right) push the (+) at bottom-right select your device, use default PIN 123456 Set the spectrum go to the Config \u0026#x2699;\u0026#xfe0f; tab open the \u0026ldquo;Region\u0026rdquo; dropdown, and pick ANZ the device will restart → \u0026#x1f3b5; Get channel config from a friend Wellington uses public channel \u0026ldquo;ShortFast\u0026rdquo; Setup \u0026ndash; optional extras Set your name Push the vertical ellipsis ⋮ (top-right) Select \u0026ldquo;Radio Config\u0026rdquo; Open \u0026ldquo;User \u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; Set your name Long name: publicly visible name Short name: publicly visible name, limited to 4 characters Push \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; wait for device to restart → \u0026#x1f3b5; \u0026#x26a0;\u0026#xfe0f; use a name other than your full legal name. Recommended because the device by default reveals your approximate position (within 100m)\nTurn off that beep! When you receive a new message, the default behaviour of the Sensecap is for it to beep repeatedly. You can dismiss that beeping by pushing the power button on the Sensecap once.\nIf dislike beeps (and are happy with just notifications on your phone):\nPush the vertical ellipsis ⋮ (top-right) Select \u0026ldquo;Radio Config\u0026rdquo; Open \u0026ldquo;External Notification \u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; Toggle \u0026ldquo;External notification enabled\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; Push \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; wait for device to restart → \u0026#x1f3b5; Change your Position settings By default this device broadcasts your approximate position (within 100m). You can change this up or down depending on your context (safety/ privacy).\nPush the vertical ellipsis ⋮ (top-right) Select \u0026ldquo;Radio Config\u0026rdquo; Open \u0026ldquo;Position \u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; Change \u0026ldquo;Smart broadcast minimum distance (meters)\u0026rdquo; the default is 100 Push \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; wait for device to restart → \u0026#x1f3b5; Important Info Message delivery is not guaranteed. There are several ways a message may not make it to the person you want it to:\nYour device is not in range of any other e.g. you are alone in an isolated valley e.g. there are heaps of buildings blocking you in There is no pathway from you to your friend your message makes it to another device, is passed on, \u0026hellip; but doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it as far as your intended recipient Missing messages is a side-effect of Meshtastics approach to replicating data. Not all mesh systems have this problem, and this is a space that is being actively researched.\nThe design of Meshtastic does let you see some information about delivery:\nDirect Message Delivery In the case of direct messages, there are 4 symbols you see\nsending \u0026ndash; a cloud \u0026#x2601;\u0026#xfe0f; picked up by mesh \u0026ndash; a cloud \u0026#x2601;\u0026#xfe0f; + \u0026#x2714;\u0026#xfe0f; delivery confirmed \u0026ndash; a person \u0026#x1f464; + \u0026#x2714;\u0026#xfe0f; error? \u0026ndash; a cloud \u0026#x2601;\u0026#xfe0f; with a line through it Group Chat Delivery In group chats it is much less clear. You may get some confirmation of delivery, but I would only trust this to mean it was acknowledged by some member of that group.\nYou should discuss with your community what your protocol is for adapting to this. A simple one would be to put thumbs-up on messages that have been received.\nDocumentation \u0026#x1f517; Official T1000e docs \u0026#x1f517; Meshtastic config FAQ Q: Can I do voice/ video calls? A: No. This is optimised to be very low-energy comms, so does not support high-bandwidth needed for live voice / video\nQ: Can multiple phones connect to a T1000e? A: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Be aware that as it\u0026rsquo;s currently built your \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; if bound to your T1000e (not your phone), meaning if 2 phones are connected, they will both be see to other mesh nodes as the same author.\nAdvanced \u0026#x1f6a7; Under construction\n","date":"2025-05-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/poneke-mesh/cover_hu_49355554402c625d.png","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/poneke-mesh/","title":"Pōneke Mesh"},{"content":"This project is a daughter of Scuttlebutt \u0026ndash; it takes a similar approach to signed, append-only logs, but radically modifies the format to fit packets of 120 Bytes (including a cryptographic signature). This makes messaging small enough to fit over LoRa, and Bluetooth Low-Energy.\nPhones replicating with nearby T-Beams via BLE, which are in turn replicating over great distances via LoRa The basic idea is you use your phone (or any device really) to publish messages (text/ audio), and then those messages are replicated over long distances using relays (for example using LoRa - a low power, radio protocol). Because all are messages are cryptographically signed, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about trusting intermediaries (relays, other peers). Other ways messages can be relayed is directly from device-to-devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (requires zero pairing, peers just need to be within a few meters, and be interested in what each other are \u0026ldquo;saying\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026#x23ef;\u0026#xfe0f; video\nThis project was created by CFT, and is an open source collaboration which spans Switzerland, USA, New Zealand.\nMy contributions thus far have been:\ncheerleader beta tester / debugging documentation grant resourcing hosting regular meetings, note-taking leading the specification writing ","date":"2025-04-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/tiny-ssb/cover_hu_a5666c59d136e7b9.png","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/tiny-ssb/","title":"Tiny SSB"},{"content":"Origins \u0026#x1f480; \u0026#x1f331; These patterns were born of the death of a friendship. TL;DR we muddled personal and work comms to the point where communication got confused, and trust broke down. We managed to name the problem, but too late to be able to recover. I was gutted \u0026ndash; I was naive, complicit, and had lost a dear friend. My response was to start partitioning my comms, obsessively asking:\nWhat is the best space to relay this message into?\nOver time this query has evolved how I think and relate. Please enjoy a sampler of how I use Signal, presented as an explorable simulacrum \u0026ndash; click in to read more about those you\u0026rsquo;re curious about.\n\u0026#x2764;\u0026#xfe0f;\nWork Chats These were the first. In Signal I started creating dedicated 1:1 chats to protect against this mistake. Here\u0026rsquo;s how that looks:\n😀 Ben + If I write something in here it\u0026rsquo;s me writing to Ben as a friend. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to worry I\u0026rsquo;m coming at him with some work request, this is about us connecting as friends. 💼 Ben/ Mix work + Work coordination. If it\u0026rsquo;s out-of-office hours, this can wait. \u0026#x2139;\u0026#xfe0f; click to expand\nFamily Chats Another reason I shifted hard into more exobrain use is also that having babies turned my endobrain into mush. Gotta record everything or it\u0026rsquo;s gone. Here are some chat groups that are just me and my partner \u0026ndash; our collective memory, sense-making, and futuring.\n🏡 Family Admin + Boring but necessary house + kid stuff. I got scared that this would dominate all my communication with my partner. Like the \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; chat above it allows us to protect our relationship (somewhat) from the onslaught of logistics.\n+ Family Health Stuff + A memory augmenting channel. Dumping observations that are maybe insignificant, but could be vital as part of a bigger arc is an easy win. Our whole family health is in here, but to give you an idea, here\u0026rsquo;s a slice of one pattern we spotted that lead to an escalation in care:\nTime Message Sep 24, 11pm \u0026lt;Daughter\u0026gt; right ear pain → paracetamol Nov 07, 8pm \u0026lt;Daughter\u0026gt; right ear sore, stopped then started. Feb 19, 10am \u0026lt;Daughter\u0026gt; doctor says ear looks ok, referring to ENT Mar 12, 2am \u0026lt;Daughter\u0026gt; woke with ear pain (left only)\n- gave half paracetamol\n- may have had some liquid come out (swimming, or burst drum?) Mar 25, 8pm \u0026lt;Daughter\u0026gt; ear seemed to clear \u0026ldquo;everything is so loud\u0026rdquo; We dump details about night wake-ups (invaluable for handing over care context), medicine administered, readings (height/ weight/ blood pressure/ temperature), questions for doctors, appointment times, notes from doctors visit.\nFormat \u0026ndash; name + topic/ body area + info Makes patterns easy to search. Timestamps are essential, but auto-added by chat.\n🌈 Read/ Watch + A record of books / films / series that we\u0026rsquo;ve encountered and would like to queue up. Raw titles alone means you lose the context for why this caught your attention, so I\u0026rsquo;d recommend a format like:\ntitle + genre + link? + why? 🎉 Family Dreams + Origin \u0026ndash; My friend Richard and his partner have a bowl of cards, and on the cards are written fun activities. When they\u0026rsquo;re bored they pull a card from the bowl, and they\u0026rsquo;re off on adventure. I copied that. When my partner or I come across a recommended location, fun kids activity, or upcoming event, they get dumped into this chat.\nEvolution \u0026ndash; It\u0026rsquo;s like a shared memory space\u0026hellip; but for for possible futures. This chat has increased our capacity for bringing dreams into the world. We started at simple (Real Fruit Ice-cream), and have grown in scale (International trip with another family), and depth (Take a night-class to explore this shy aspect of myself).\nI cannot recommend this pattern enough. 💬 😅 Family Quotes + Origin \u0026ndash; We have two young kids and wanted to remember some of the crack-up things they\u0026rsquo;ve said.\nTime Message Jan 14 Son : I have the opposite program to most people. I have my dreams while I\u0026rsquo;m awake instead of while I\u0026rsquo;m sleeping. Apr 19 Daughter : I feel bad, like I hurt someone\u0026hellip; but it\u0026rsquo;s just that I fell in love with tacos Apr 21 Daughter : hey I\u0026rsquo;m following you, you\u0026rsquo;re the role model\nGrandma: don\u0026rsquo;t follow me \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I\u0026rsquo;m going! Evolution \u0026ndash; One of the greatest gift kids offer is the chance to see the world afresh. Their observations are uncoloured by idioms, uncluttered by\u0026hellip; \u0026lsquo;grown up\u0026rsquo; context? Their questions side-step social norms and drive (unknowing or sensing?) into the heart of things. We\u0026rsquo;re invited to reflect on our assumptions, our knowledge, what we really values, and to summarise those thoughts in under 2mins in simple terms.\n🥵 Only Fans (not lewd) + Origin \u0026ndash; started as a joke chat. I added my partner and posted a couple cute selfies.\nTime Message Jan 24 This chat is being repurposed frow sfw duckface selfies to things I love about our life and want to remember to share with you Mar 2 mix : \u0026ldquo;remind me about leadership call\u0026rdquo;?! partner : thanks! I scheduled that message 5 days ago, you\u0026rsquo;re like my meatware in this situation mix : I am your meatware, that\u0026rsquo;s what we signed up for partner : awww Evolution \u0026ndash; reflecting on what having a \u0026ldquo;premium subscription\u0026rdquo; might mean, I noticed this channel was a perfect place to post post celebrations of beauty we see unfolding in our lives, appreciation of one another, and the occasional insights from therapy. T_T Emotional Damage + Origin \u0026ndash; Inspired by this comedy video, this started as a high-context, high-trust channel for my partner and I to vent about those cringe or painful moments in life.\nEvolution \u0026ndash; Laughing together at a predicament is a quick way to affirm shared values and step away from any fight/flight/freeze/fawn response. If it\u0026rsquo;s not funny, then we can move into more careful support of each other. Whatever the path, stabilisation/ alignment/ destressing make it easier to engage curiosity, name the kernel of any conflict, explore upstream solutions, etc. ❤️ Relationship Retro + My partner and I run monthly relationship retrospectives. You can read about that pattern here, and evolutions of our process on the Multiamory podcast [1] [2] !\nThis is a simple shared memory archive. When we decide on an iteration of something we\u0026rsquo;d like to try out, we record it here. This helps us loop back to reflect on how experiments have gone. Later this will likely enable us to reflect on what we continue to struggle with, how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come, and what our relationship is. Community Chats Here\u0026rsquo;s a collection of groups I\u0026rsquo;ve participated in. Each of them has it\u0026rsquo;s own dynamics regards the flows of information, the pattern of relating, and what they brought more into the world.\n🌅 Pōneke Toddler Wranglers + A support group for a group of 18 parents who were friends and happend to have kids around the same time. This group has covered planning playdates, re-sharing cool event, shared summer holidays for the past 4 years, hand-me-downs, baby-sitting, emergency support, etc.\nI deliberately added sharing of vulnerability to this group. I role-modelled not knowing, I asked for help. I was met with support, and observing safety and care, others followed suit. I think this deepened relationships, increased resilience, and turbo-charged our collective sense-making. 🐚 Social Labryinth + I met a nice guy at Dweb Camp, and said \u0026ldquo;we should keep in touch!\u0026rdquo;. He dropped me into a Signal chat with 23 people called \u0026ldquo;Social Labryinth\u0026rdquo; with zero context. Turns out this was a group of people that were mostly friends of his at the conference, along with a handful of seemingly aligned odd-bods.\nI have never seen such sustained and rich discourse beyond a conference. I attribute this to the lovely host, their great taste in friends, and our alignment in interests (all at a radical tech conference). This group went on to birth another parallel group, an online conference, and many of the people I met are now trusted peers and collaborators.\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 🤡 Clown Capitalism + The origin of this group are somewhat shrouded in mystery. It seems like I made it as a joke in 2023 and then forgot about it, only to stumble across it a year later while searching my chat for clowns.\nOver the past year this chat has evolved into a critical discourse on clowning, their role as bridges between possible realities, and has been slowly gathering real clowns who are now helping shape the conversation. Was I always a clown, or am I becoming one? ♻️ Knowledge Ecology + I met an Ecologist at a conference, and really wanted to learn more about the systems thinking lenses of Ecology, and how this person had been applying them to groups. We are both short on time, so started a chat group as a way to share learning through dialogue. Along the way we\u0026rsquo;ve been adding resources and people that match the theme.\nWe could have just kept this as a DM chat, but opening this to trusted friends we were able to share learning more widely while also building trust as we observe mutual friends interacting. 🚴 Spare cycles for commons + This is an off-shoot from a chain of collaborations between myself and nonlinear. We share a passion for building human-centred digital commons. A major challenge is there are so many open-source projects / tools that auditing and testing them as an individual is overwhelming.\nThe focus of this group is then \u0026ldquo;do you have a spare 30 mins to kick the tyres on a project?\u0026rdquo;. We post links to things that have crossed our radar \u0026ldquo;anyone seen this?\u0026rdquo;, and either someone has or maybe we co-ordinate a small scouting party to go test it out and report back. Cheerleading is also welcome. This is gentle volunteering.\nFunctionally we are surfacing aligned tools, extending our capacity to sense, progressing common-good, and making friends. Cybernetic Sovereignty Not sure how many are familiar with Cybernetics. As a primer for those who things it\u0026rsquo;s just about cyborgs:\nThe central theme in cybernetics is feedback. Feedback is a process where the observed outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways that support the pursuit, maintenance, or disruption of particular conditions, forming a circular causal relationship.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very interested in the feedback loops present in our information systems. In the above sections you see me externalising and collectivising large parts of my memory, sense-making, and future dreaming. Concretely, Signal is now a core part of my cybernetic feedback loop \u0026ndash; I take actions which effect a system, and then I sense the reaction(s) of that system, which stimulated further actions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Signal, because the accessibility and activation cost is very low, and because Signal give a shit about privacy/ security. I would have to be in a bad place to be doing this on a platform that reads the content (see Meta, Google), or in any way shapes my feedback loops. To be crystal clear, feedback manipulation you should watch for is any place algorithms are being tuned to decide the relevance your posts/ events\u0026hellip; based on the advertising goals or political agendas of the host corporation. DEI no longer in vogue? How do you feel about you your discourse and event organising being tuned down, gradually disappeared?\nWhile Signal is great, I am not happy about how fragile Signal is to disruption. It\u0026rsquo;s feasible that someone dragging an anchor could cripple New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s internet, severing me from my communities (and exobrain). If there was a fantastic p2p replacement that had the right security trade-offs, and accessible UX, I would jump.\n","date":"2025-04-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/cybernetic-signal/magmatic-channeler_hu_9eef5cb7403f9b75.jpg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/cybernetic-signal/","title":"Cybernetic Signal"},{"content":"Children are kinda messy, a bit grimey, and a little mischevious\u0026hellip; like goblins.

For example \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s meet at the zoo at 2pm\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; sounds easy enough, but then toddlers don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily sleep on an exact schedule, and there is a greater than zero chance someone could spew in the car on the way there. Multiply these unknowns by the number of participants and it can be pretty easy for plans to only semi-align, or totally bomb.\nThis can generate feelings that range from mild stess (am I waiting for X to arrive before we go into the zoo?) through to total bummer (I was really looking forward to an adult conversation). A particularly painful failure mode is the \u0026ldquo;after bedtime han-gout\u0026rdquo; where no children are present (read: this is my time off), where some kid need arises, you are wrenched back into duty, and your plans are cancelled. Deep expectation-reality whiplash.\nIf your plans involved other people with limited resources, you\u0026rsquo;re probably also carrying the cost to the group in mind e.g. their expectation-reality whiplash, and the cost of having the try to re-schedule a hang out.\nDecomposing the problem I noticed the crux of the pain for me was the sharp divergence of reality from expectation. Why was this happening? I think because my internal narrative was too binary, that is only had two modes:\nhangin out ⇒ \u0026#x1f604; no hangs ⇒ \u0026#x1f62d;. What if we told a story which was more nuanced\u0026hellip; reduce the surprise of the flip between these states. Could we take in all the variables, name and acknowledged the uncertainty, and build our story on that? Sounds like it might be too complex, but you\u0026rsquo;ve seen this pattern before ⇒ weather forecasts!\nSo I started experimenting with a friend I play Magic with. Our conversations shifted from being more of a roller-coaster:\nMix : How are things looking for a game tonight? Eric : \u0026#x1f44d; Yeah I\u0026rsquo;m on! See you at 8pm \u0026hellip; Mix : 😕 you coming? Eric : 👀 yep, just running a little late\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; Eric : 😔 Look I\u0026rsquo;m really sorry, I gotta cancel, child spewing\nMix : 😭 oh no! good luck\nTo a really smooth expectation ride:\nMix : How are things looking for a game tonight? Eric : ☔ 30%, my youngest has a cold, stay tuned! Mix : ❤️‍🩹 No pressure this end\nMix : ✨ Let me know if the stars align! Otherwise catch you another night\nUpdated forecast One of the joys of this is that just like a weather forecast, your forecast of the likelihood of a date working out can evolve over time:\n⛈️ 40% we have quite a few lemons on deck ☁️ 60% grandma said she can take a kid! ☀️ 85% sick child is asleep 🙌🤞 If you want you can front-load a little context about the lemons (complexity/ challenges) that are introducing uncertainty, then subsequent updates can be really brief, even just \u0026ldquo;20%\u0026rdquo;.\nContrast this with trying to protect people from complexity (not wanting to prematurely complicate or worry), but then feeling pressure to offer apologies, AND explanation, AND in the exact moment of some disaster unfolding \u0026#x1f44e;.\nCommitment + Context One thing I immediately noticed was that communicating this way separated our commitment to the relationship from the challenges of our context.\nIn the past I feel like generally people wanted to make a plan work \u0026ndash; to honour the organising + time people have contributed, the relationship \u0026ndash; and that to cancel plans felt like some damage that needed acknowledgement and repair.\nNow I it\u0026rsquo;s really easy for me to say:\n\u0026#x2764;\u0026#xfe0f; I would love to hang out with you! (commitment) ⛈️ 60%, here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m working with (context) My commitment + context can now be expressed orthogonally 🤓. It feels like it unlocks a lot more compassion / kindness, which is especially helpful for anyone navigating relationships intersecting with complexity, be that kids, mental health challenges, disability etc.\n","date":"2025-03-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/forecasts/cover_hu_5d403e3ebaebad57.jpeg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/forecasts/","title":"Forecasts ⛈️  ☀️ "},{"content":"Originally published on Scuttlebutt in 2018. Additional section added with updated learnings.\nWhen I was a teacher I worked with this guy Pete Brailsford, who taught mountaineering. He\u0026rsquo;d take students up into the snow and build snow caves to sleep in overnight, cross rivers, stuff like that. A major part of the learning in that context was about managing risks. The idea is that you can\u0026rsquo;t control everything, but you can keep an eye on the probability field you\u0026rsquo;re standing in.\nHe talked about it like a slot machine - those ones where you pull the handle and then the options spin and then they lock in like:\n\u0026#x1f352; \u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x1f352; \u0026#x1f352; \u0026#x1f34f; Normally if you get all cherries or something, it\u0026rsquo;s a jackpot, but in this story, if you get a row of lemons, that\u0026rsquo;s bad, like \u0026ldquo;you got hypothermia and no-one knows where you are\u0026rdquo; bad.\nSo you can\u0026rsquo;t control all the slots, but you can watch where you\u0026rsquo;re at. Say you set out on our adventure, the slots are spinning, and you know what, someone in our group forgot their jacket BOOM the first slot just came up\n\u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x2b1c; \u0026#x2b1c; \u0026#x2b1c; \u0026#x2b1c; Ok it\u0026rsquo;s a lemon, but no big deal, it\u0026rsquo;s sunny as. You stop and have lunch, there\u0026rsquo;s some clouds on the horizon, but it\u0026rsquo;s so warm. Guess what you just missed a hint, and as you continue to walk it starts to rain and a wind picks up (being a small island in a massive ocean, weather can change very quickly in nz) \u0026hellip; now you\u0026rsquo;ve got 2 lemons\n\u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x2b1c; \u0026#x2b1c; \u0026#x2b1c; Again this is not that big a deal\u0026hellip; except you already have that 1 lemon, so now you\u0026rsquo;ve got someone in your group who\u0026rsquo;s getting cold. I guess you can see the trend. Any one of these things is no big deal, but a series of little misfortunes have a cumulative effect in terms of the odds you\u0026rsquo;re playing with. So if you\u0026rsquo;re in this position\n\u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x2b1c; You\u0026rsquo;re now playing a very high stakes games, where one more little lemon, like a sprained ankle can tip you over into disaster.\nHow to manage lemons Lemons aren\u0026rsquo;t always avoidable, but you can often plan ahead and consider what the odds of lemons are based on different paths. Further, you can reflect as situtations evolve, asking yourself:\nHow many lemons are we currently at?\nJust having this self-reflective question in your toolbelt can change how you think and see. It can be really hard to spot them because they can often be innocuous in the context where they first present \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s just in concert that the the real trouble manifests. Asking this question out loud to yourself and your questing party can help you spot more of them early, as well as increase the liklihood you\u0026rsquo;ll keep them in working memory (most humans suck at remembering many small factors).\nIf you spot yourself crossing 3-4 lemons, you should probably be starting to significantly re-asses your plans. Things like:\nabort: ask yourself if your initial plan is still safe simplify: consider cutting non-vital parts of your plan alert: increase new-lemon vigilance, prepare to escalate responses faster But mix, I\u0026rsquo;m not a mountaineer This is relevant to anyone on any adventure (solo, or as a team). You could be voyaging into literal mountains, or sailing to Great Barrier Island, or you could be a distributed team building FOSS tools on a limited / no budget.\nSome lemons that have fucked up quests I\u0026rsquo;ve been on:\nhaving no retrospectives (process for iterating, adaptation) just trusting that everyone remembers the agreement we made (contracts, pay, expectations) forgetting to ask how people are feeling \u0026ldquo;figuring it out later\u0026rdquo; for on-boarding / off-boarding / holidays / sick leave not telling each other vital quest-changing info (assuming mind-reading or avoiding conflict) being unclear on who\u0026rsquo;s doing what using too many different tools for communication / coordination being unclear about ownership / responsibility saying \u0026ldquo;this is a flat structure, everyone is equal\u0026rdquo; (but not actually doing anything to actively distribute power) forgetting to account for how disruptive travel can be Sometimes the course you take has known lemons. Like it\u0026rsquo;s hard to set up holiday pay processes when you\u0026rsquo;re a small company and you know everyone and you\u0026rsquo;re doing it for love and there are so many things to do. You just need to acknowledge (and remember) that you\u0026rsquo;re carrying a lemon, and if you then try to onboard someone new, you need to adjust your plan by either stopping to build that missing stuff (unloading the lemon), or communicating to the new person clearly about the known lemon.\nLemons in family systems UPDATE: I\u0026rsquo;ve added this section because it\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;ve most used this personally, and why I reference this pattern so often.\nWhen I say \u0026ldquo;family system\u0026rdquo;, I mean any group of people very strongly committed to supporting one another, such that the wellbeing of any one person in the system strongly effects the wellbeing of the system as a whole.\nExamples of family systems I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that this is relevant for:\nparent(s) with kid(s) partners where at least one has a disability partners where at least one has mental health challenges You know if you\u0026rsquo;re in such a family system when e.g. one of you gets sick, and the experience is like the family is sick. The arc of recovery is often slower too, because of the complex interactions involved in one person getting taken out.\nNoticing lemons We don\u0026rsquo;t track lemons all the time in our family. Lemons in themselves are not bad \u0026hellip; unattended compounding lemons tend towards disaster though. Typically we start engaging this pattern when we notice ourselves generally \u0026ldquo;unreasonably stressed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;a bit overwhelmed\u0026rdquo;, or even just \u0026ldquo;unproductive\u0026rdquo;.\nThe next step is to pause and name the lemons we can spot. I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a bit overwhelmed today, so here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n\u0026#x1f34b; work \u0026ndash; my work is in transition, lots of uncertainty \u0026#x1f34b; community \u0026ndash; my school picnic got quagmired, lots of painful learning \u0026#x1f34b; health \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve had a low level cold for 2 weeks, have had a few nights of bad sleep \u0026hellip; Okeee, so we\u0026rsquo;re at 3 lemons already, and that\u0026rsquo;s only counting the complexities I\u0026rsquo;m holding\u0026hellip; No wonder I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a bit overwhelmed!\nCompassion Even noticing that you\u0026rsquo;ve carrying a bunch of lemons can be transformative. My first step is usually to laugh a little, and feel a little bit of relief \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m not useless, we have a lot on! \u0026#x1f605;\nHaving some compassion for ourselves can immediately unload shame / guilt / pressure, which is very strategic, because:\nyou just cut a meta-lemon (wasting brain cycles beating yourself up) you likely have less of a white-knuckle death-grip on your initial plans, making it easier to adapt to your actual reality Complexity capacity \u0026#x1f34b; \u0026#x1f944; Another pattern we use in our family is Spoon Theory. The core idea is that if you\u0026rsquo;re living with some disability you may have very limited capacity, and that we could model how much capacity people have with units of capacity, spoons \u0026#x1f944; say. A person with very limited capacity might start the day with 8 spoons, and then have to ration their spoons over the day e.g. shower costs 1 spoon, commute to work costs 2 spoons etc). If you run out of spoons\u0026hellip; maybe you cannot get home, maybe you can but end up in massive spoon-debt (goodbye tmrw).\nExpanding spoons from the individual (to collective capacity) and blending in the lemons pattern, we can start to say things like \u0026ldquo;today we only have capacity for 2 lemons\u0026rdquo;. Lemons here represent complexity which will incur spoons (capacity) cost.\nThis feels kind because it acknowledges our current capacity, and helps us bound expectations of how much complexity we can perhaps carry.\nConcretely, while going to a kids birthday in the morning followed by a friends bbq in the afternoon may seem easy, if we only have 4 spoons, and this plan takes us to 0 spoon exactly\u0026hellip; that leaves no capacity for unforeseen lemons, which world put us in spoon deficit. Better to plan one just the one activity and have spare capacity for curveballs and still be within safe operating bounds.\nThis concept is also useful in the context of startups. Startups are typically operating with very limited resources (spoons). Basic operations cost capacity (spoons), and innovation tends to cost in unforeseen complexity (lemons). To that end it\u0026rsquo;s important not to innovate on too many fronts simultaneously. Examples of things which incur complexity cost:\n\u0026#x1f34b; \u0026ldquo;fancy\u0026rdquo; legal structures - e.g. coop, foundation + for-profit symbiosis, \u0026hellip;. \u0026#x1f34b; novel technologies - e.g. encrypted replicatable database \u0026#x1f34b; ethical investment mechanisms - e.g. non-voting shares, redeemable preference shares, \u0026hellip; \u0026#x1f34b; world-spanning teams - e.g. NZ, EU, USA ","date":"2025-03-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/cover_hu_2932d74c77c998f1.jpg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/","title":"Lemons 🍋🍋🍋"},{"content":" ⏳ 2024 \u0026ndash; 2025 About Entropy has been a few things over it\u0026rsquo;s lifetime.

In essence a new sort of coordination and financial tooling.\nThe core proposition was\nusers can set up \u0026ldquo;accounts\u0026rdquo; which have configuration held on a global blockchain.

In the context of magic, a ward is a charm or enchantment, usually cast on a place and set up to bar evil from entering, while letting the good pass freely. I’m not sure where I picked this concept up, it’s quite likely playing Magic the Gathering (which ironically enough is itself a ward).\nOne time a friend of mine threw a P-party (not the drug, like the letter P). Being a contratrian who enjoys squirreling out edges cases, I went as a Pterodactyl. My costume was hastily put together - I made a large cardboard mask (masks and identity are another fascinating thread, but for another time), didn’t have time for wings, so put on a suit, and tied a tie to my belt as a tail. Come monday, my belt still had the tail, and I decided to skip figuring out the knot and wear it to work (I was a highschool teacher at the time).\nThis was motivated by: laziness, enjoying attention, opportunity to systematically break peoples models of me, and role modeling it being fine to be a weirdo. I got reactions similar to what you experience if you’ve ever shaved your head or similar - some people making a big deal of it, some people ignoring it.\nBut there were nuances in there which were super instructive. Some people were super judgey “why are you wearing a tail?” (said with a frown and concern). Wow, that was an incredibly quick shortcut to learning you’re closed minded! Getting to skip a bunch of pre-amble and have a conversation about what we really value in people and society was super great. Or if the context wasn’t right, to just laugh and walk the fuck away. For some people it surfaced insecurity. The principle of the school (a 60 year old kinda old fashioned but kindly white dude) approached me after a meeting one day and said in an embarassed aside:\n“Huhuh, Mix I notice there are only two of us wearing ties, and I’m wearing mine around my neck and you’re wearing yours around your arse\u0026hellip; I can’t help wondering if you’re mocking me!”.\n“Huhuh, yeah”, I said ambiguously.\nI also attracted allies. One of the students who chose me as a mentor wore bunny slippers everywhere (she was way ahead of me on being a delightful weirdo). At one time we had a teddybear onsie which people casually wore around. One of my parents turned up to a meeting - “I was at a fabric store the other day and they had these fluffly offcuts, and I thought of you”, she said, holding up a furry strip of fabric. So my tie tail got upgraded to a full on furry tail… why not I guess?\nFucking with gender as a ward Living in an age where gender roles are really prescriptive really sucks. It’s been really great to explore what not being what dominant culture might call manly. What’s it like to be able to be vulnerable, try to understand your feelings, and integrate that into your relationships? Pretty fucking great.\nWhat’s it like to notice that all the mens clothes in a shop are boring, and buy something ‘made for women’ which you feel great in? Excellent.\nMy friends and I are into really open communication, nail painting, and wearing whatever. Mikey looks gorgeous in a dress. Here’s me rocking a gold lamé top I found at my mother in laws place\u0026hellip; I’m giving a talk at a JS conf in New Zealand.\nNerddom as a ward I play Magic the gathering. People have feelings and thoughts about this. Same about Science Fiction. (Oh boy don’t get me started on talking to people who enjoy ‘literature’ as higher form of writing and look down on sci-fi)\nSolarpunk? Are you willing to engage with a genre which is optimistic and not yet clearly defined?\nWear your nerddom like a badge, loudly, with pride. Great asshole detector, and you’d be surprised how many nerds there are out there lurking.\nMagic/ mysticism as a ward You might have seen some of the language of magic swirling around the scuttleverse. I deliberatly discuss rituals, which I think of as ‘known repeatable patterns which invite awareness, and weave bonds amongst us’. Christian culture may have baked a distrust of ritual into your psyche, which is pretty funny given how littered with ritual the church is. To be clear, Thanksgiving, Mothers day, Birthday Parties, Show and tell, Checkin rounds, Retrospectives are all powerful everyday rituals.\nBUT, using more pagan language is a great ward, and it’s flavourful and fun!\nOther magic to watch out for : #invocation, smudging, crystals, alchemy, sun and moon apps, wizards (I told Piet’s wedding he was a wizard - which I define as a socially AND technically talented humyn)\nThis isn’t an accident. I find magic really deeply evocative and playful. And a super effective ward - Zach! has a fantastic story I’d love to invite him to share about running his Solarpunk Magic gatherings.\nInvoking a warding strategy ‘Ward’ might not be a perfect title because it more strongly represents guarding than welcoming, which is a shame. Nevertheless I am inviting you to cast off and ignore normative culture and proudly wear your marginalised culture, whatever it is.\nBy making things which are purple, and have rainbows, by being cute, or nerdy, a little bit magical, or a little bit dirty because you’re building a boat with your hands, you’re representing that which you love.\nIf other people don’t think that’s scaleable, GOOD. Scaling is normative capitalistic mindset and warding against that is a gift. It also means we’ll spend more time meeting beautiful colourful humans who are curious and care about others.\n","date":"2018-08-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/deploying-wards-for-you-those-you-love/cover_hu_9d5a7ae047f89bfb.jpg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/deploying-wards-for-you-those-you-love/","title":"Deploying wards for you \u0026 those you love"},{"content":"About Some friends and I were exploring blockers to cryptocurrency being accessible and identified that \u0026ldquo;recovery\u0026rdquo; (of secrets) was perhaps the number 1 challenge.\nIn 2017 I\u0026rsquo;d messed around with Shamir\u0026rsquo;s secret sharing, and we noticed that we could use this concept in concert with a social network in order to safely store backups.

Over the past 3 years, friends and I have been growing and shaping an ecosystem for that purpose — for many, it’s now our primary way of communicating. It’s built with cryptography and is p2p. The result is a system with fundamentally different behaviours than the old web. This is part of a series exploring the sociological and technological ramifications. I call it “The Medium is the Message: Cypherspace Edition”.\nSpeaking at a recent re:publica conference, my friend Rich Bartlett voiced his lack of faith in blockchain as a solution for all that ails us. Specifically, he threw this challenge:\n“If you’re going to claim that your project is decentralising power, please explain it in terms of justice, rather than just efficiency and disintermediation.”\nThis got me wondering how our project Scuttlebutt, a decentralised social network, is any different from other hype. Most pressing was the question, “Can we guarantee that people will be safe from bullying and abuse?” If we can’t build a community which is free and open for everyone to participate in — if it’s a space where some people are sexually harassed, or receive threats of violence — then we’re wasting our time.\nOur decentralised architecture certainly makes global spamming attacks hard, and data only flows along lines of trust. But it’s still technically possible for people to abuse others within our community, particularly if they have a lot of friends in common. In our history to date, we’ve only had a few incidents of behaviour and communication that run strongly against the community culture I want to support.\nSo how have we dealt with abuse?\nJust kick them out On corporate platforms like Twitter, Youtube, or Facebook, there’s a single central organisation with (essentially) a single data storage system. In that context, it’s easy for the owners of the system to delete content or users — in fact it’s their prerogative and, some would say, responsibility to do so. Most platforms have a “report” or “flag” feature which marks content or users for review/exclusion. This can be good, but also results in endless arguments about these rulings, since policing and judging fairly is expensive and difficult.\nCompanies like Reddit get around some of this overhead by being a platform for community-moderated ‘subreddits’ (channels for specific topics). Sometimes Reddit admins will still step in and ‘moderate’ user content, like when their CEO messed with Trump posts , which was simultaneously funny and pretty troubling.\nAs a federated network, Mastodon takes this a step further — communities self-host their own ‘instances’ of the platform, meaning there are many self-governing fiefdoms. Each sets their own rules and can kick content and people off their instance. It’s great because there’s no corporation shaping your experience, and you don’t need one policy to cover all the people in the world. The challenge is you have to be fairly organised as a group to set up and pay for the infrastructure, and to actively govern your space.\nScuttlebutt goes even further: it’s fully decentralised, with no single central organisation or federation of fiefs. There are only fully autonomous peers, each running the software on their local computer and making their own choices about how they want to interact.\nThere is no owner of any shared physical space or hardware from which you can kick a person.\nThis is the double edged sword of p2p social networks — it’s a space safe from authoritarian interference and it’s harder to assert boundaries.\nHave a strong culture As described above, this decentralisation might sound like total anarchy. It is, but maybe preconceptions have coloured your expectation of how this might pan out. In practice, what emerges is not that different to other networks — people migrate toward and away from conversations and people they want to interact with. We see ‘islands’ or ‘domains’ of community, which might be distinct, overlapping, or totally disconnected. It’s similar to the dynamics of Twitter, but while Twitter’s global space leaves it open for witch hunts and hashtag storms, Scuttlebutt is more localised and stable.\nWhat is culture in such a fragmented space?\nI can only talk about the parts of the Scuttleverse I interact with. It’s filled with open-source programmers, communists, vegans, feminists, sailors, and mycologists — and not capitalism or trolls.\nThe community space around me has something like emergent governance. When someone presents rough behaviour, it’s common for one or more people to intercede and apply some combination of:\npolite inquiry and clarifying questions assertion of what sort of interaction they’d prefer This costs time and energy, and it’s totally worth it.\nAs individuals and as a group, we get the opportunity to:\ncheck our assumptions, and (maybe) build connections with new cultures clarify our beliefs and who we are role model what respectful conversation and good boundary setting looks like Our conflicts have advanced us individually, and as group we have built stronger relationships and are more skilled and articulate. I absolutely believe this is the fundamental and unavoidable work of community, and that community is integral to any human ecosystem.\nThis is all really cool and cerebral, but does this stop rape threats?\n(Hasn’t happened yet to my knowledge, but it’s a decent question.)\ninformation flows in a peer network\nBlock them This is the feature I’ve just finished building. Applying culture only gets you so far — it can’t necessarily protect you from a malicious actor.\nIn an extreme situation, the things I want you to be able to avoid are:\nbeing contacted by someone being stalked by someone The first one is easy to implement — you can just tell the interface to not show anything new from that person. What I’ve built actually goes further, by ceasing propagation of that person’s data to friends of yours not already connected with this person.\nThe second part is harder. We’re a p2p network, where messages are gossiped — how do you say things publicly and have them not get to that person? You tell your friends that’s what you want, and they respect your decision!\nIn programmatic terms, a ‘block’ is just another type of message which is gossiped. As soon as a peer receives it, their local setup effects the change and tops passing information about you to the person you’re blocking.\nIn a p2p context, being blocked means you have fewer connected peers, because the number of people gossiping your messages is reduced. Highly abusive characters might find themselves enjoying just the freedom of their own speech, alone.\nThe Medium is the Message Marshal McLuhan coined this iconic phrase, and I’d summarise it roughly as, “The physics of your medium determine what is possible in that medium, and so ultimately the message.”\nGiven Scuttlebutt is a cypherspace (a space whose foundational physics is cryptography), what is the nature of the medium that is different here, and what is that message?\nThe underlying cryptography is what makes it possible for people to be totally autonomous agents in this social network. It affords a level of freedom from coercion that is probably unprecedented in a digital space. It also removes all responsibility for governance or custodianship of a space from any particular entity and devolves it to the level of individuals making choices. So far in the Scuttleverse, I’ve seen this lead to a lot of personal responsibility and growth.\nIt’s also fascinating to watch how the lack of dependence on shared hosting infrastructure means that we can have a multiplicity of overlapping communities. A recent example was when I found a user, who calls themselves Johnny Null, in the #dads channel (which I started because I’m going to be a dad soon, and wanted to talk about that with other crypto-dads). I was surprised, because I had experienced a lot of antagonistic threads with this person, leading to some of my friends blocking him, but I hadn’t yet.\nIn this new context, I wasn’t seeing unproductive abuse from him. We found another way to connect on a really human topic. I was surprised to learn he was a dad, and to receive encouragement and offers of support from him. It was such a sharp contrast from previous interactions. The diversity of approaches available made it possible for some people to block him, but he wasn’t banned from the network, leaving open new possibilities. I don’t know where that will go … but perhaps we could still have a chance at understanding each other.\nI see alignment of the physics of p2p space and the physics of everyday in-person space. It feels poetic that the way we’ve implemented a block in Scuttlebutt is through communicating boundaries and asking our peers to respect them. That’s how it works in offline spaces, too. I see this pattern a lot in what we’re building — p2p interactions mirroring human interaction — and it’s the heart of what I want to communicate by invoking The Medium is the Message.\nBuilding systems with peers means the tools we build might be just a little more human, and make space for adaptive communities. My hope is that this space will help us re-learn some of what we’ve forgotten in society, and that maybe this will make a difference in the rising challenges we have to face.\n","date":"2017-09-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/personal-safety-in-a-p2p-social-network/cover_hu_2d22221d446f185c.jpg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/personal-safety-in-a-p2p-social-network/","title":"Personal Safety in a p2p Social Network"},{"content":"Protozoa is a tech coop, and we write open source code. This is a little bit about what that means, and how open source is the foundation on which we\u0026rsquo;re building an aspirational future.\nI recently published a new feauture for Patchbay - an open source project I maintain. It allows you to easily @-mention people in the scuttleverse. This isn\u0026rsquo;t straightforward because it\u0026rsquo;s a decentralised space where identity is subjective - many people have more than one use-name. (I gave a whole talk on subjectiviy here).\nI mention Mikey by a name that people in our coding context will be familiar with (dinosaur).\nWhy is this significant?\nI\u0026rsquo;m proud of this feature, but the more important parts of this story are the open source and the cooperative culture making this possible.\nOpen source Over the next couple of days, I\u0026rsquo;m going to generalise this code into a module called patch-mentions. Then I\u0026rsquo;m going to propose changes to Patchbay, and a sister project called Patchwork so that they use use this new module.\nThat way everyone gets the new functionality, and when we find bugs in what I\u0026rsquo;ve done, we\u0026rsquo;ll all benefit from the solution. I\u0026rsquo;ll also be able to use this in subsequent contracting work - a massive speed and reliability boost for myself and for clients.\n(I\u0026rsquo;ve actually already done this with a couple of other modules patch-profile (an easy profile editor) and patch-settings (which manages client preference settings).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re talking to a programmer about what excites them about open source, this is probably the heart of it. Every time someone generously shares their work, we save hours / days / weeks of work, and are able to channel these savings into things that matter - like making more accessible interfaces, or building a feature to flag abusive actors (next on my todo list).\nCooperatives Protozoa is a worker owner cooperative. While I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, Piet and Dominic are hard at work on different things - contract work, and forming collaborations with other decentralised projects (we\u0026rsquo;re currently crushing on the Economic Space Agency a bit).\nFor us, contributing to the commons is an important part of our work - it makes all our future work better, and helps build working relationships with other excellent humans.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of that:\nTableflip are a UK based tech coop we\u0026rsquo;ve been working with. We met them through the scuttleverse and this is a calendar invite to a catchup planning more work in the future. By working together, we\u0026rsquo;re able to work on bigger and more exciting projects with the confidence that we can expand to support each other.\nThe cal invite here is another tool we built is called gatherings. It\u0026rsquo;s a module Piet and I made to enable more community interaction. Other gatherings I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the past week in include \u0026ldquo;Art~Hack Wellington: decommidify your creativity\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Westhaven Car Boot sale\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Bad Ukulele Club\u0026rdquo;.\nIt feels amazing to have been able to support more connections between people, and to be doing business in a values aligned space - I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t know TableFlip\u0026rsquo;s email addresses\u0026hellip;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re an excellent human with a rad project you\u0026rsquo;d like to collaborate on, we\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you.

As a summer experiment, Josh Vial mentored a group of people in how to code. (This may have been the alpha cohort foreshadowing Dev Academy.)\nI left art school, joined Loomio, and extended my radical (i.e. anarchist) teaching skills into the space of collective organising, facilitation, and agile development. I did a range of contracts through a collective called CraftWorks (also part of Enspiral).\nTeaching Programming Having validated an opportunity for a different sort of tertiary eduction around programming, Josh Vial and Rohan Wakefield launched Dev Academy. The format was something like a remote prep course, follow by a 9-week long in person intensive course.\nI was invited to do mentoring for the early cohorts, and ultimately moved into full time teaching. The teaching team in our era ran somewhat autonomously - we created and evolved curriculum, hired our own staff, and coordinated with the rest of the organisation.\n\u0026ldquo;Teaching\u0026rdquo; at Dev Academy was similar and different to Unlimited. Everyone on the course had explicitly chosen and opted in to this very specific pathway. It was incredibly intense - the amount of ground we covered over 9 weeks was\u0026hellip; quite like being thrown in the deep end, relentless. However we coupled the technicalities of the conceptual code learning with an strong structure of personal support - teaching personal reflection, interpersonal communication tools, and providing close mentoring and counselling.\nSo\u0026hellip; once again seeing the humans holistically, treating learning as a deeply personal journey (not just an exercise in content) - of relationship with yourself and with others.\nLegacy It was at Dev Academy that I met Piet Geursen. We formed and enduring relationship through teaching and leading together, and went on to found a cooperative together - Protozoa.\nI supported several friends into careers programming through Dev Academy. Some of them are now coop members too! Āhau + Mātou\u0026rsquo;s are also projects that were founded by several Dev Academy graduates.\n","date":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/dev-academy/logo.svg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/dev-academy/","title":"Dev Academy Aotearoa"},{"content":" ","date":"2017-03-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/nzjs-17/cover_hu_91811f007698bb54.png","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/nzjs-17/","title":"Embracing Subjectivity"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a critical thinker. I\u0026rsquo;m a coder with a background in maths - I excel at taking ideas and problems apart. The blessing of this is that I understand systems I work with intimately, perhaps even better than others. The curse is that some-times my deep-analysis mode presents like \u0026ldquo;pointing out all the problems\u0026rdquo;; a nay-sayer; a devils-advocate.\nIf you relate to any of things, welcome, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this for you - you have a Black Hat. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this because having a Black Hat is a super-power, and if you\u0026rsquo;ve got one you\u0026rsquo;re probably deploying it sub-optimally. Here are a couple of easy tweaks to get the most out of it.\nKnow when to use it (and keep your friends!) In the context of collaboration, I\u0026rsquo;m fantastic at reviewing, seeing vulnerabilities, and threats. Historically, I\u0026rsquo;ve also generated a lot of pushback for quashing fledgling ideas, or \u0026lsquo;always seeing the negative\u0026rsquo;.\nLooking at de Bono\u0026rsquo;s thinking hats, has been a real help for me. There are six of them, each representing a different style - or mode - of thinking, de Bono proposed was that a lot of tension in a groups emerges from different people being in different modes. (In computer security, there are also \u0026lsquo;hats\u0026rsquo;, try the post-script for a mapping between the colours)\nFor example in a visioning session, I deploy the Black Hat (critical thinking), because it\u0026rsquo;s a strength of mine. Meanwhile others in the team are wearing the Green Hat (generative, exploratory thinking). The combination feels bad, because most people know that things being suggested aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect - that\u0026rsquo;s not the point of the exercise at this point - but I\u0026rsquo;m doing the opposite of creating, I\u0026rsquo;m bringing nothing to the table, I\u0026rsquo;m just cracking the things other things are bringing open.\nThe problem is that I\u0026rsquo;m just leaning on my strengths - this is a common and lazy habit of Black Hats. If you notice yourself being called a devils advocate, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably fallen into this trap. Generally people don\u0026rsquo;t like devils advocates and if you persist you\u0026rsquo;re in for a bad time.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t use your hat, just know when to use it - check in with your group about what \u0026lsquo;mode\u0026rsquo; we\u0026rsquo;re wanting to be in. If we\u0026rsquo;re doing exploring, lets agree to be Green Hat, and then agree when we\u0026rsquo;re ready to shift to stress testing the new ideas all at once (with our Black hats).\nHow to be think critically AND generatively This is what I\u0026rsquo;m most excited about. It\u0026rsquo;s the realisation that you can use you Black Hat to spot threats or weaknesses, and then put on a Yellow Hat. If the Black Hat is the destructive critical thinking, the Yellow hat is the future-facing critical thinking about our values. (This might not have been de Bono\u0026rsquo;s intention, but bear with me.)\nFor example, I\u0026rsquo;m currently teaching a group of coders at Dev Academy. There\u0026rsquo;s this dynamic emerging where 3 of my students are excellent at asking questions. I noticed I was feeling annoyed, and my Black Hat says \u0026ldquo;These students are dominating the air-space, to the exclusion of the quieter students, and to the exclusion of the women in the group\u0026rdquo;. It goes on \u0026ldquo;There are gender and societal dynamics at play here, I wonder in what ways I could be contributing to this?\u0026rdquo;. The solution that comes from this hats thinking is \u0026ldquo;You need to tell them to stop asking questions and tell them we\u0026rsquo;re making the gender gap worse\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile this is kinda the desired outcome and there is truth in it, it lacks compassion, and sure as hell isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be received well.\nBy pivoting into my Yellow Hat, I\u0026rsquo;m able to ask the critical question \u0026ldquo;In what ways is falling short of the desired values I want us to be living?\u0026rdquo; Which leads to the subtle shift in focus \u0026ldquo;What are the values I want to be living here?\u0026rdquo;\nThe answer is easy and I kind of already knew it but it was tangled up in my Black Hat deficit thinking. Clearly resolving \u0026ldquo;I want everyone to be practising confident question asking, so they can be well equipped for their career.\u0026rdquo; meant resolving the situation was a piece of cake. I invited the confident 3 to a conversation, told them the value I wanted to realise, and invited them to help me.\nTL;DR - applying critical thinking to underlying values (as well as the problem) will help you see and communicate more clearly.\nThe difference between this solution and the Black Hat-only one is that it has baked into it the aspirational end state. If others don\u0026rsquo;t agree with that aspiration, that\u0026rsquo;s a fricken fantastic thing to talk about - you\u0026rsquo;re going to skip out a bunch of painful mis-alignment.\nMost of this learning was possible because of the incredibly supportive and nourishing atmosphere the Enspiral network is growing. Particular families I\u0026rsquo;ve had the priveldge of learning with / alongside are Loomio, Dev Academy, LifeHack, EXP, Root Systems.\np.s. mapping for Security Hat\nde Bono Security Black Black - cracker, approaches offensively, is interested in poking holes White + ?

Like being alert for musky over-ripeness somewhere in your fridge, or unwanted acridity of burning plastic coming from your computer, smells hint that nearby, something is amiss, and it’s probably going to get worse.\nIn code it’s usually that you’ve used a pattern that seemed good when you started, but as you continue to add things, suddenly it gets volatile. An everyday example would be running too many appliances off a multi-board.\nPatterns of coding that lead to future instability we call anti-patterns.\nCode smells are the whiffs that help us notice anti-patterns. Naming them helps us spot vulnerabilities, avert catastrophes, and support an evolving discourse about best (and worst) practice.\nMy flatmate just came back from a conference where she was pulling her hair out because the way the group was working together was counter-productive. It occurred to me that it would be useful to port anti-patterns into the group-work context.\nI want to know what group-smells are. Here’s a few we were able to name in my lounge just now:\nCargo-cult collaboration A variant of Richard Feynman’s cargo-cult science, this is implementation of collaboration through shallow adoption of whatever latest buzzword.\nA classic example you might hear is people asserting “we’re a totally flat self-organised group”. Self-organisation is a thing, but it doesn’t grow just anywhere. There are certain conditions in which it tends to work well, and many in which it doesn’t.\nSome smells to watch out for :\nlack of clarity about where and how decision making is happening invitation to ‘be the change’ without any guidance/ support to do that no description of what or how self-organisation is going to occur founders deny their power and leadership not everyone feels empowered to intervene in group processes The anti-pattern :\nyou think you’re making space for an ecosystem to magically appear, but you forgot to resource it Where this anti-pattern can lead :\ninvisible power structures which privilege some actors without them being aware of it emergent inside / outside groups poor communication systems that lead to distrust people taking on too many things and burning out white men dominating lots of things, women doing administrative roles Patterns which support self-organisation :\nnaming power / leadership roles that exist actively sharing roles around making decision making processes clear clear communication systems Talking over each other This one is easy. In the best case, everyone just cares a lot about the topic of conversation, and they’re excited to share what the conversation is bringing up for them.\nOther smells you might notice :\n2 people having a conversation, while everyone else watches anxiety about when you’re going to get to speak lots of loud people, no quiet people an old white guy opinion-fest The anti-pattern :\nyou’ve skipped an agreement about how you’re going to approach things, and conversation has defaulted to loudest / most dominant Where this anti-pattern can lead :\nless listening less diverse opinion shallow analysis Patterns you might consider that help:\nappoint a facilitator introduce a rule (e.g. talking stick, or you can only talk again after 2 other people have spoken) change the format (e.g. split into smaller groups, get everyone to write thoughts on cards, go for a walking dialogue) Miscy meeting (pronounced ‘misky’, *misc = miscellaneous,) There’s a bunch of you in a room talking about your project and raising relevant ideas. The conversation energy is good, and you’re discussing all the things. This is a great space for combining ideas, exploring shared values, and connecting with each other. If you were intending to run a discovery session, or a workshop, that\u0026rsquo;s great. If you were expecting decisions and action, it might be worth checking whether you\u0026rsquo;re in a miscy meeting.\nYou might smell:\nno-one recording any actions / agreements surprise at the topics being raised (lack of agreement about why you’ve met) topic drift / people changing topics annoyingly excited exploration of rabbit-holes no clear ending to meeting The anti-pattern :\nyou haven’t agreed on what you’re actually doing, so you’re starting a range of things and doing them poorly or not at all. Where this anti-pattern can lead :\nmassive waste of group time frustration when people remember agreements / actions differently in the next meeting more miscy meetings, gradual loss of momentum inability to unlock continuous improvement / evolution Patterns for clearer meetings :\nstart by asking ‘what is the purpose of this meeting?’ use an agenda, and refer back to that when needed record agreements / actions (and who is going to do them) and share call ‘rabbit hole’ when you smell one use some ‘meeting ending’ ritual (e.g. a checkout-round) so everyone knows when you’re done and don’t auto-extend your meeting ad infinitum These are just a sample of course. Lets spot anti-patterns together and name them. Lets spot group-smells and do better work together. I’d love to hear of any common anti-patterns you’ve already named in your group work, please post them up.\n","date":"2016-07-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/group-smells/cover_hu_e0c5d8cb96beec45.jpg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/group-smells/","title":"Group Smells"},{"content":"I value conciseness so here\u0026rsquo;s what I think the essence of it is:\nPower dynamics hamper learning What a waste of potential My History There\u0026rsquo;s a chance I\u0026rsquo;m wrong. Here\u0026rsquo;s my story if you want to parse it yourself.\nSchool As an inquisitive (and naive) teenager, I judged IT largely by what was offered at school. Touch typing, some HTML maybe, but none of the really beautiful stuff. The offering was boring and unchallenging compared to centuries-old maths and sciences.\nUniversity My inquiry led me to study neuroscience, which turned out to be a bit too reductionist to practically help me understand people (so western!). I graduated as a mathematician, and after failing as a post-graduate research assistant (modelling blood splatter of blunt weapon trauma), I took a government subsidy to train as a teacher.\nI\u0026rsquo;d really enjoyed tutoring at university, but found that my higher education on education guided me into surprisingly unsavoury amounts of acting (playing some authoritarian role) and crowd control (learning tricks to manipulate group social dynamics to maintain control).\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the length of hair or the height of socks. Quiet (but noticed) protest looked like attending careers day and meeting prospective school principals in ripped jeans. I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother attending my graduation (NOTE\ngoing off piste often requires more paperwork later). The irony of teaching engaging learning in a lecture format was a laugh, but the university did introduce me to Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery - the only high school I would take a job at. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t an act of rebelion, more an extension of my stubornness and pickiness (which I was rich enough to be able to afford).\nWhat was so attractive about Unlimited was the atmosphere (or people dynamics).\nRadical Education Unlimited is a state funded public secondary school that exists because of a loophole in the law, which allowed the bending of a rule meant for the integration of church schools into a rule which allowed the school to write its own assessment rules. Its \u0026ldquo;special character\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;a fundamental tenet that the child is central in directing his or her own learning so that the enthusiasm and love of learning is retained.\u0026rdquo; My kind of place.\nI can talk a lot about what made that environment transformative, but I think the key was radically more equal power dynamics. As a Learning Advisor there, I didn\u0026rsquo;t assert authority through enforcing arbitrary rules. I had conversations on a first name-basis with people about what they cared about in life. Classes didn\u0026rsquo;t have age-barriers, and students could choose what they wanted to do every 5 weeks. Instead of segregation and age-based hierarchy, there was conversation and experiementation.\nIt felt good. People were kind (not to be confused with nice), and they learnt a lot. Instead of negotiating bullying and claustrophobia, students spent their time doing things like attending university level classes, running New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s only OpenDNS server from a bedroom, and working together to support a friend with depression. Some of the experiences moved me so deeply I still cry when I recall them.\nMost state education is missing the mark by a wide margin. It makes me thoroughly sad - and angry.\nArt School I loved Unlimited, and learnt an enourmous amount there, but I left to stretch skills outside of teaching. There was also a massive earthquake that destroyed the city. I moved to attend art school, where I got into programming the laser cutter (which I was shocked to find almost no one else was using).\nI was the worst adult student - I know what good education looks like, and I like giving feedback. The context and tools were great but the educators (outside of the pure theorists) were weak.\nI left and did some relief teaching where I tried to treat students as equals. I was horrified to discover that the acting I\u0026rsquo;d disliked in state teaching is a two part play, and exiting a play is hard when the other actors are continually asserting your role. Genuine conversation was overridden by a race to establish dominance and control.\nSocial Enterprise Over a summer break I was introduced to Joshua Vial who taught me (and several others) to be web developers. I took these skills and helped build Loomio (an open source collaborative decision-making tool).\nThe people of Loomio - and the garden-nebula Enspiral within which it grew - were the next group of most excellent people I met. This is where I was introduced more explicitly to a discourse around power.\nMore Radical Education I\u0026rsquo;m now a teacher at Enspiral Dev Academy, a coding bootcamp that trains non-technical people to become junior web developers in 9 weeks. It\u0026rsquo;s a synthesis of my interests to date - programming, learning, and community building.\nI take myself, and those around me to and beyond the limit of our technical ability. The only way you can do that effectively and get anything out of it is to be super up-front about what you do and don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nPower and Knowledge Not knowing things for some reason brings up shame for people. The most dangerous thing for a student is self-doubt, and sitting on shame is a good way to get that. This is another topic I\u0026rsquo;m currently really interested in, and will write more on some time.\nI think that might be a study in itself, but I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in how not knowing plays out for teachers, because I believe this is the reason I\u0026rsquo;m not currently an ascendant cyber-wizard.\nWhen you don\u0026rsquo;t know a thing as a teacher, a very interesting decision path emerges:\nA) lie\nB) admit you don\u0026rsquo;t know\nWhy would you lie? Well, if your position as teacher is predicated on your knowing more, being the source of truth, then not knowing might seem to undermine that.\nThe average high-school teacher is in a surprisingly precarious power-position - it might look like they have control, but only through carefully guided consent of the class.\nFor a teacher in a position where their authority is coupled to their knowledge, it is awfully appealing to steer conversation away from topics which might erode that position.\nI think this is why classes on computers suck so bad in high school - they are born of institution, which is established in such as a way as to bind teaching to the bounds of individual mastery, which is finite.\nEducation around computers offer a unique window into the future of learning. The field is moving so fast, that the only reasonable path is to say \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo; a lot. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, then talking about new and relevant ideas won\u0026rsquo;t be part of your curriculum.\nIn many educational institutions, saying I don\u0026rsquo;t know is not safe for educators. Generally they are in systems that give them positional authority to solve the \u0026lsquo;behaviour management\u0026rsquo; problems. They are generally not afforded humanising tools of social safety, like building genuine relationships, or sharing vulnerability.\nThis does everyone trapped in that dynamic a huge disservice. Both teachers and students achieve less understanding, less empathy, less collaboration, less critical thinking, etc. The learning is poorer.\nNot knowing as Power Being able to say \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo; is the beginning of some fantastic cascading effects:\nreveals \u0026lsquo;students\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;teachers\u0026rsquo; both as learners opportunity to model good learning critical thinking/problem solving (process over rote learning) asking for help listening shows teacher as human, relatable more trust, less lying more humanistic dynamic, better conversations drop shame, move to a growth mindset go beyond boring \u0026lsquo;safe\u0026rsquo; topics interesting, inspiring engaging (perhaps people like me 15 years ago) play This is how I see power dynamics hampering our learning.\nI\u0026rsquo;m investing in education systems which set aside positional authority, and foster environments in which it\u0026rsquo;s safe for everyone to be vulnerable. For older systems, I\u0026rsquo;m building an evolving book format, designed to open education resources and support teachers to transition from authorities to guides and catalysts of learning.\nI\u0026rsquo;m excited to be working in a community which is supporting me to develop a different sort of learning pattern for myself. Maybe if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky (and persistent), we can shift learning patterns more broadly.\nI would love to hear from anyone else playing the long game of reshaping education.\n","date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mixmix.nz/p/power-and-learning/cover_hu_309532bdf56e8b9.jpg","permalink":"https://mixmix.nz/p/power-and-learning/","title":"Power \u0026 Learning"},{"content":"So I hang out with a bunch of big dreaming nerds with a bunch of different interests, but when we explore what it is we want in our future, it\u0026rsquo;s a happy thriving civilisation. You\u0026rsquo;ll know we\u0026rsquo;re there because we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking after each other, curiously exploring, sharing our successes, and making intergalactic friends.\nThe workshops were about developing a Theory of Change for each group.\nTheory of Change\nThe process of forming a Theory of Change is about coming up with a map of how change will come about in the world. It starts by a group building a shared vision of it\u0026rsquo;s particular desired end-state is.You then proceed to build a graph of dependent states back from that end point to the current state of the world. This is called \u0026lsquo;back-casting\u0026rsquo;.\nThe process has several steps including things like surfacing and testing assumptions, detailing how you would measure successful change at each step, and assessing the cost and nature of intervention to prgress between states.\nIn each of the workshops, 2 hours of conversation made barely a dent in completing a fully detailed map, but we\u0026rsquo;d revealed a lot of territory. Both workshops explored similar veins, but here I\u0026rsquo;ll explore the second, because it\u0026rsquo;s fresher in memory and highly relevant to my current work.\nWhy build a decentralised database? This is a workshop I ran with the Secure Scuttlebutt team who all happened to be in San Francisco recently. Here\u0026rsquo;s what the top of our theory of change diagram looked like :\nSome important things we agreed we need to achieve were :\nspecialisation without inequity rich ecosystem (supports diverse approaches) I\u0026rsquo;d like to explore one particular chain of states back. This format makes it hard to simultaneously discuss the branching and interconnected dependencies, so please forgive me if the analysis seems to narrow. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in this particular chain because it raised questions which provided a useful frame or lens for projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on or with. From the top it reads :\nGalactic council Large scale social harmony Post scarcity Distribution primarily in service of society Distribution is distributed and un-ownable We build our distribution on un-capturable technologies As distribution surfaced as a theme, we tested our assumptions against real-world examples :\ndistribution of food and goods: supermarkets, walmart distribution of information: email, google, facebook We observed that ownership of distribution by actors mainly interested in profit has lead to problematic dynamics which block us from joining the Galactic Council. See massive food waste, destruction of diversity through monopoly, development of tools which optimise addiction and consumption, development of tools which define value for us.\nSome examples Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of a couple of interesting cases in the context of information distribution.\n[Email] : a super successful open protocol. Anyone can send emails to anyone. The failing of email is that it has no mechanism for dealing with un-wanted noise (see spam). This has generated a niche for organisations to offer value (spam filtering), and capture users. For example Gmail is popular because it does fairly reliable spam filtering. This makes email less open, because small private servers have a harder time generating a good \u0026rsquo;not-spam\u0026rsquo; reputation.\nDistribution systems must have a solution to noise.\n[Facebook] : built on an open protocol - http - but has centralised closed databases, and a closed (proprietary) interface. Facebook\u0026rsquo;s primary motivation is profit, which inclines it to leverage it\u0026rsquo;s closed-ness (right of refusal of access) to extract value from it\u0026rsquo;s user-base.\nAll parts of a distribution system need to be uncapturable - open protocols are not sufficient\nfacebook ToS\n[Google] : the growth of the internet beyond easily navigable scales led to the birth of search engines. The current winning solution to this problem is an algorithm which determines site value based on linkages and references. Again, this is a niche which has been captured by a primarily profit motivated organisation. This capture looks something like a monopoly through dependence, and is defended by a suite of related free and powerful tools.\nDistribution systems need to address capturable searchability\nThings you should consider I\u0026rsquo;ve named a bunch of assumptions and principles that we think need to be integrated in order to get us on the road to The Galactic Council.\nWhat is your interaction with distribution systems, are you investing in systems that build the future you want to see?\nHow do you network online, is it via an actor interested mostly in profit? Who holds power over the definition of value of what you\u0026rsquo;re interacting with? Where do you publish your content? I think it\u0026rsquo;s overly idealistic to transition immediately to decentralised uncapturable solutions, but there are small choices that we can and should start making if we want to live in a thriving society.\nPossible solutions Open-sourcing With Loomio (a collaborative decision-making platform), we\u0026rsquo;ve addressed some of these same problems by a steadfast commitment to being open-source. While individual instances of the platform may have closed databases, the open-sourcing of the platform code means that anyone can own and control their own instance. It also makes advertising and data-mining significantly less likely, because anyone in the community can fork the code-base and rip anything extractive out. For Loomio this is actually a selling point - it\u0026rsquo;s a clear signal that our primary value is in serving society.\nWith Loomio, capturing ownership has also been very seriously addressed in how we\u0026rsquo;ve written our constitution, and our approach to investment. In short, you can\u0026rsquo;t buy Loomio, and no one person can control it.\nPublish carefully You might notice this isn\u0026rsquo;t published on medium. Honestly, this is an experiment in document splicing using a tool I made currently called Hypermarkdown. In retrospect this approach does tick some boxes. This content is currently being hosted at github.com\u0026hellip; which sounds like my content might be captured buuuut, github is acutally built on a distributed content system called git. An exact mirror of the data lives on my computer as well, and could easily be hosted by any git based server, like a self-hosted gitlab.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s still the problem of how it is you\u0026rsquo;ve found your way to this blog. 99.9% liklihood is that in 2015 it was via facebook, or twitter (it probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t via google because the way I built this accidentally makes it harder to index).\n(Edit (2025) - I\u0026rsquo;ve since pulled this into another git repo which generates this static site using Hugo)\nBuild an open combined protocol-database The solution I\u0026rsquo;m currently investing in is Secure Scuttlebutt . It\u0026rsquo;s an open and secure decentralised database where distribution flows along trust lines, as determined by following (positive value) and flagging (negative value).\nAnyone is free to build an app to interface (read/ write) with this database. The first app is a proof of concept messaging app called Patchwork.\nCheck out a brief introduction +\nThe Scuttlebutt team is planning to open beta Patchwork in November 2015.\nAn overview of scuttlebutt\u0026rsquo;s solution to some know problems with distribution systems:\nAll open uncapturable system: the protocol is open and the database is open and distributed. People can only edit their own data and reference others. Has an uncapturable solution to noise: distribution only flows along trust lines in the network. Searchable: relevance is similarly determined by trust relationships in the network.

The training was pretty meh, but I wandered into a skype call with this place called Unlimited (some polytechnic or something?), anyway young people telling us about producing albums, making video games, managing their own time and talking like mature adults. Towards the end of the call it turned out we\u0026rsquo;d been talking to high school students as young as 14. I asked for a placement there, and after doing practicum in the sort of place where people gave a fuck about other people and supported actual learning I refused to take a job anywhere else.\nSo I lived in Christchurch for 4 years and, and worked with some wonderful learning advisors and some amazing young people.\nVignettes Some communities have a sort of magic that\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to convey. I could disect the anatomy / physics of this beautiful space (and I think about this a lot!), but as an introduction I\u0026rsquo;ll instead share a couple stories, because for me it\u0026rsquo;s through interactions that the heart of a system is revealed.\nTrainee Teacher I\u0026rsquo;m a trainee teacher in a maths class, there\u0026rsquo;s a student swinging on their chair and looking out the window. Here\u0026rsquo;s the dialogue between the learning advisor (Duncan) and the student (Hamish)\nDuncan: Hey Hamish, looks like you\u0026rsquo;re not getting much done\nHamish : Nah, I\u0026rsquo;ve got this big event coming up this week which I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about (sport/ music? I can\u0026rsquo;t remember)\nDuncan: Oh that\u0026rsquo;s cool! What\u0026rsquo;s that about?\n\u0026hellip; 5 minutes of genuine conversation about shit that matters in Hamish\u0026rsquo;s life\nDuncan: Hey, so it sounds like you\u0026rsquo;ve got a bunch on. If you want to go have a nap or read a book under that tree, we can catch up on your maths later. Or if you\u0026rsquo;d like to give the maths a go, we\u0026rsquo;ve got another 15 minutes left of this class.\nThings that stood out clear as day to me :\nno bullshit authoritarianism, i.e. I was expecting \u0026ldquo;DONT swing on your chair, GET BACK into focus!\u0026rdquo; (teacher training taught me that ~ 50% of the job is coercion / crowd control / acting) the \u0026lsquo;student\u0026rsquo; was open and honest it was an even mature conversation the outcome was awesome, everyone won (was respected, and supporting the student\u0026rsquo;s learning was 100% nailed) Real learning Later, when I was an Learning Advisor (official role title, re-centres \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; as supporters, facilitators, mentors), I had a group of students who\u0026rsquo;d chosen to work with me (mostly nerds). On of them (Harley) was keen to go skiing.\nHarley: hey Mix, can we go skiing?\nMix: Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to take you skiing if you figure out all the logistics and safety and stuff.\nHarley: \u0026hellip; ok, what do I need to do?\nMix: I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but we could talk to Peter, he does mountaineering courses and knows how to do risk assessments or whatever\nSo we went skiing. Responsibility was shared, Harley and friends learnt how to budget, plan, and coordinate. We did similar things all the time, like making a ~VR headset with wii controllers, and building a RepRap (3d printer\u0026hellip; this one got interrupted by the quake).\nEveryone is a teacher, everyone is a learner Every wednesday afternoon the whole school would stop and do some sort of exercise. The most minimal one was Walking - we\u0026rsquo;d walk through the CBD and around the gardens of Hagley Park (Christchurch has a huge central park). My first time out, I lost like 60% of the students, and was freaking out. When I got back, my supervising teacher said \u0026ldquo;oh yeah, they\u0026rsquo;ll have just walked home, it\u0026rsquo;s fine\u0026rdquo;.\nLater I ended up taking kids who wanted to go skateboarding to the skate park. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to skate at the time, and one day one of them said \u0026ldquo;Hey Mix, you should learn how to drop in on the half-pipe\u0026rdquo;.\nPart of me was like NOPE but the other part of me was like \u0026ldquo;You gotta do this, it\u0026rsquo;s really important you role model incompetence and perseverance in learning\u0026rdquo;. So they taught me very kindly and patiently how to skate. After a month of this, we\u0026rsquo;d built a bunch of trust and the boys were asking what other classes I took and genuinely sounded open to checking out stuff they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t otherwise have been into. You can grow curiosity. Relationships matter.\nThe school had a core mantra: everyone is a teacher, everyone is a learner. This story kinda sums that up for me.\nStudents also taught me to how to \u0026#x1f512; pick locks, \u0026#x1f355; trade Bitcoin for pizza, \u0026#x1f697; change the oil on my car, etc.\nEarthquakes At the time of the quake, I was 2 blocks from the city centre, on my way to a teachers union meeting.\nMajor traumatic events do weird things to your perception and memory. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how long the quake was (it was 30s to 2 minutes?), but I do remember thinking I was having some sort of brain breakdown, or drugs, or .. my vision was fucked. The trees - giant oaks - were melting and waving \u0026hellip; so were the lamp-posts. When the rolling stopped, I wondered if it had been a bomb. Where before there was a block of buildings on one side of the park there was a building sized cloud of dust\u0026hellip;.. it was a totally opaque wall of dust rising into the sky.\nTo be honest, I paused before wondering if I should go back to the school - maybe fuck everyone else? I figured trying carefully might be ok. By this time the half dozen teachers I had been walking with, only 2 were still there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where everyone went. For sure those with children of their own left without pause at top speed. As we made our way back towards the school (a 4 storey building on the other side of the city square, 3 blocks away), we passed people saying things like \u0026ldquo;The Cathedral is down\u0026rdquo;. Not being inclined to investigate, the 3 of us set out to go the long way round. One of us decided to cut through an arcade with a glass roof. I chose to take another street. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much discussion.\nI found two of my students in togs (swim-suits) with towels. I told them to put their shoes on.\nAs we passed through taller buildings, there were sounds like rubble and glass falling, and hissing \u0026hellip; like broken water mains, or was it gas? I had a weird echo of experience playing FPS games \u0026ndash; I knew the rules, it was DO NOT stand still, keep your head, and keep moving.\nHaving people to look after helps a lot. As we walked there were people all walking around on the road. Some were moving quickly, others were consoling people crying. There were also people just standing and staring.\nWe found a train of students exiting the central city, being guided by teachers (there were only 4 adults in the school of 400 over the lunch because of the union meeting). I become a redirection node, like in that classic game lemmings. I found myself directing adults who were wandering as well.\nWe ultimately joined the train, and made our way to a nearby park. As we went, the students in the towels (I think?) asked me \u0026ldquo;are those people ok?\u0026rdquo;. I said I didn\u0026rsquo;t know, and that we needed to keep moving. I was later told we walked past people bleeding from injuries, and past bodies being pulled from the rubble. We also walked passed a film studio where my girlfriends flatmate worked. It was flat. Of the 4-5 storeys, there was nothing but the stairwell. He died in there, along with dozens of others. I remember seeing that, and the noxious smoke coming out of the rubble, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember seeing any dead.\nWe got to the small park (2 small city blocks in size), and started to try to take stock. I understand more how and why the Romans organised they did (under standards/flags, with command-tents, and information runners). It was pretty chaotic. Try organising ~400 people with no spatial physical system. Hierarchy and layers of responsibility become really valuable. Over time a triage centre and helipad were set up down one end of the park. I stayed till dark as friends and family picked up children. We took food from the nearby supermarket I think?\nI met up with my girlfriend, we walked through the deserted streets. Down one street cars were half sunk into the road like the ground was quicksand (liquefaction).\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know if my house was still standing. The tunnel to Lyttelton was closed. The next day, 4 of us decided to risk driving over the hill. We passed a house that had a hole the size of a truck through the middle where a boulder had passed straight through.\nOur old wooden flat was fine, but there was no running water for days. We shat in plastic bags for a bit, but soon dug a shit pit to squat in. There was a huge tanker of water brought in and parked down in the center of our little town. You could go get buckets or bottles filled down there. Civilisation gets pretty intense pretty quick without water.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll write about the damage to the social fabric later.\nMore learning I stayed a year (or more?) after the quake. The school was seriously disrupted (moved half-way across the city, sharing with another school), my relationship broke up, I did some therapy.\nI was in my 20s, and I\u0026rsquo;d just poured 4 years of my life and soul into lifting up others learning and lives. I wanted to do some of that for myself, so I decided to move to Wellington and attend Art School.\nReflections I think Unlimited did a great job of wrapping support and guidance around students. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t an environment which worked for everyone. I think if I was to change one thing given years of perspective, it would be to weave more collectivism into the spirit of the place \u0026ndash; extend the focus beyond \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s my learning pathway?\u0026rdquo; towards \u0026ldquo;what can we achieve together?\u0026rdquo;.\nUnlimited forever changed how I see institutions and learning. I was radicalised\u0026hellip; am now forever an advocate for holistic education, of systems which embed care.
