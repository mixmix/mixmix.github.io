I'm from Aotearoa (New Zealand), was born on the [Heretaunga
Plains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretaunga_Plains), and grew up on the
hills of Te Mata Peak. I'm a first generation kiwi -- my mother came here from
Scotland as a Teacher, my father from England as a Mainframe Engineer , they met
sky-diving. I live in Pōneke (Wellington) with my partner
[Alanna](https://alanna.space), and two rascal children. My name is Mix.

:information_source: _Introductions in NZ are
[context-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepeha) -- the "individual"
is better understood by where they stand, and who they relate to._

I'm a nerd -- I love sci-fi, magic the gathering, programming, ecosystem
tuning. I love people and community, so I've spent most of my adult life in
groups of nerds gardening community -- teaching, writing code that serves
people, weaving chat groups, and hosting picnics.

## Double Edged Swords :crossed_swords:

I think many of the things which distinguish us from one another are strengths
in some contexts and weaknesses in others. Understanding these helps us know
in what environments we will thrive, where we might need support, and who we
might work really effectively with

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>Precision</h3>
  </summary>

I tend to load a lot of detail in when trying to understand something. If I'm
making some discernment/ judgement, I want to understand the veracity, the
context, the relationships. Glossing over detail feels wrong to me. I'd
rather defer -- keeping possibility space open -- than jumping to wrong
conclusion.

**Positives** :+1:
  - very thorough reader
  - spots edge cases in systems _(quirks which lead to unintended consequences)_
  - asks incisive questions
  - understands deeply
  - forebearant _(not quick to judge)_

**Negatives** :-1:
  - slow reader
  - analysis paralysis (load more context than is needed)
  - mistaken for critic/ pedant _(deep understanding == care though!)_
  - stickler for words
  - slow to label bad actors
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>Sensitivity</h3> <!-- Wide-sense? -->
  </summary>

Sensory input (particularly aural, visual) that is out of place or unusual
stand out a lot to me. I don't think I have super-powered sense organs, rather 
my sense processing is tuned a little different than others.

**Positives** :+1:
  - spots errors
  - matter-out-of-place memory → quick at finding
  - finds broken things _(electronics, pipes, machinery)_
  - hears upset children/ stuck animals
  - can rock-hop at speed

**Negatives** :-1:
  - odd sounds pull my attention like a fox _(out of conversation)_
  - struggle to parse voices in crowded / reverberant environments
  - annoyed by dying fluorescent tubes
  - disturbed by tree pruning / removal

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>Long-game</h3>
  </summary>

When I find something I love in the world, or something that has potential for
greatness, I often ask myself "how could more people benefit from this?" or
"what would further enhance this?". I'm thinking in the long term, about scaling
the pattern I see, and ensuring it's longevity.

**Positives** :+1:
  - sees potentials
  - amazing first-follower / cheerleader / support character
  - very active bridger and weaver of people
  - unperturbed by any short-term awkwardness _(e.g. love giving constructive feedback)_

**Negatives** :-1:
  - jumps too far ahead
  - chronic feedback _(it can be very hard for me to not share important data)_

## Second Opinion :people_holding_hands:

You shouldn't necessarily trust people's narratives about themselves. Here's
what some friends say about me. If you think there are things missing, get in
touch and I'll update <3

        created it, but Mix played a unique role that hardly anyone else did:
        he welcomed and cared for every newcomer, was a mediator in
        discussions, proactively connected people outside with people inside,
        and fostered collaboration across projects
