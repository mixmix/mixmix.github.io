This project was a collaboration with peers from the Dweb Community, many of
whom I met through Scuttlebutt and Dweb Camp work. We wanted to continue
connecting, learning from one another, and to build more centers for connection
beyond the one we'd mostly been gathering around in California.

Decent Social was a 24 hour rolling conference that spanned 3 timezones
(Asia-Pacific, Africa-Europe, and Americas). We (the organising team) put a lot
of work in making the event accessible, and safe for participants. I was the the
regional host for Asia-Pacific, and on call for any moderation or Code of
Conduct issues.
