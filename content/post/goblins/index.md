Children are kinda messy, a bit grimey, and a little mischevious... like
goblins. As our kids grew we had nick-names for them and some of these evolved
into a developmental progression of goblin-ness.

Here are the phases I have mapped so far :
<br />


<details>
  <summary>
    <h2> 1. 🥔 Potato</h2>
  </summary>

When humans are born... they're kinda par-baked compared to other animals, as
in they're not ambulatory, and only just aware of their environment.  Some
people talk about this as the "fourth trimester". Somewhat uncharitably I call
this phase the Potato.

  <summary>
    <h2> 2. 👶 Chublin </h2>
  </summary>

Your goblin is somewhat active and has started looking a little roley. They've
got creases part way down their limbs, big cheeks, and very little neck to
speak of. 

Chubby goblin => Chublin.

<details>
  <summary>
    <h2> 3. 💩 Grublin </h2>
  </summary>

Your goblin has moved on to solids. They make a significantly larger mess
consuming food, and their output is a new level of nasty.

  <summary>
    <h2>4. 👹 Grumplin </h2>
  </summary>

Your groblin is growing a lot (which hurts) and they've also developed enough
theory of mind to realise they can say "No!", and just straight up defy your
requests.

  <summary>
    <h2> 5. 👺 Squablin </h2>
  </summary>

Higher cognitive functions are online, your goblin can now make reasoned
attacks on your authority.
