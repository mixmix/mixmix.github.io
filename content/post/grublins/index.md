Children are kinda messy, a bit grimey, and a little mischevious... like
goblins. As our kids grew we had nick-names for them and some of these evolved
into a developmental progression of goblin-ness.

Here are the phases I have mapped so far :

    <h2> 1. ðŸ¥” Potato</h2>
  </summary>

When humans are born... they're kinda par-baked compared to other animals, as
in they're not ambulatory, and only just aware of their environment.  Some
people talk about this as the "fourth trimester". Somewhat uncharitably I call
this phase the Potato.

    <h2> 2. ðŸ‘¶ Chublin </h2>
  </summary>

Your goblin is somewhat active and has started looking a little rolley. They've
got creases part way down their limbs, big cheeks, and very little neck to
speak of.

    <h2> 3. ðŸ’© Grublin </h2>
  </summary>

Your goblin has moved on to solids. They make a significantly larger mess
consuming food, and their output is a new level of nasty.

    <h2>4. ðŸ‘¹ Grumplin </h2>
  </summary>

Your grublin is growing a lot (which hurts) and they've also developed enough
theory of mind to realise they can say "No!", and just straight up defy your
requests.

Higher cognitive functions are online, your goblin can now make reasoned
attacks on your authority.
