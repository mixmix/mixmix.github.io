<!-- Backstory -->

In 2015 I was working in a social enterprise space, and some people in our crew
started porting some of the process tools used to navigate complex dynamic
projects into the personal-relationship space. 

It started with my friends Chelsea and Ants deciding to date, and to run that as
a series of time-bound experiments. 1 week dating, then stop, reflect, decide
whether to continue, then same again at 2, 4, 8 weeks etc.  We laughed about
that, but in short order several of us were doing periodic "retrospectives" on
our relationships. Alanna wrote a blog about our process -- [Running Agile Scrum
on our Relationship][] (2016). This was picked up by the Multiamory podcast and
they iterated on our recipe, releasing [RADAR][].

We were stoked to hear so many people enjoying this pattern. RADAR is a great
resource, though I want to add a couple things to help make all this feel more
accessible.


## A Primer on Iteration

> TL;DR -- continual improvement over perfect plans

Businesses (and relationships) are complex systems in that they have a lot of
moving, deeply inter-related parts, and are embedded in still greater
ecosystems. Navigation in such a context can be really challenging, and there
are a lot of tools which can help. My favourate of these "the feedback loop". 

If we extend the sailing metaphor, a feedback loop is as simple as :
  1. Take a bearing -- where are we now?
  2. Set a course -- what should we move towards?
  3. Sail a bit
  4. (repeat)

This doesn't preclude having a long term goal / desired destination, but it does
acknowledge that you're sailing with a certain amount of "unknown", and complex
interactions may mean you find yourself "off-course" and need to adjustments.
What I really want to emphasise is that we discard the impossible ideal of "a
perfect course to desired end" and replace it with "an ongoing journey of
improvement".

In software development we often use Scrum / Agile and the feedback loop looks like:
  1. Take a bearing -- what have we just built?
  2. Set a course -- what should we build next?
  3. Build a bit
  4. (repeat)

But we ALSO apply the feedback loop to the our team process too (it's part of
the building, why not?):
  1. Take a bearing -- how we feeling about that last round?
  2. Set a course -- any changes we should make to how we're working?
  3. Do a bit
  4. (repeat)

In the context of a ship, this would be like a crew evolving their roles/
protocols/ processes e.g. _"hey they chef is sick... how about we each take a
turn cooking for the next week?"_.

Retrospective just means "look back", but it's often used as a short hand for
the process where we get together and "Take a bearing" and "Set a course". 
In an Agile/ Scrum context, there's usually a time/ energy constraint -- once
again, the goal is not perfection, it is to use feedback loops to incrementally
improve over time. As long as you trend in a good direction you're winning. This
means things like:
- we may surface 10 issues... but we don't expect to "solve" them all, as long
  as we progress 1 of them in the next sprint, that is progress
- we don't know the the perfect solution to this issue... but we can "try
  something" and see how the system responds... and can try something else next
  time if this doesn't work


## Our Current Process

We run relationship retrospectives ~ once a month, and set aside 90
minutes uninterupted time for our process. This is a ritual which draws a bunch
of energy, so I'd strongly advise not going over 90 minutes - it can burn you
out.

Here are the phases:

### 1. Load Context

Check-in by sharing how we're currently feeling, what we're arriving with _e.g.
I have a didn't sleep well last night; I have a headache._ Remember the last
month, review our calendars, and speak out loud the important landmarks.  e.g.
_We were all sick for a week; You finished your government contract; I finally
got back to my exercise routine; We had that fight._ 

**Time** -- 10-15 min

> **Why** -- In checking in and remembering the last month we're aligning our
> contexts. Knowing I have a headache helps us communicate better by improving
> your model of my current state. Reing reminded of we each found important
> helps prime us for things we might discuss, and factors that are going to feed
> into those conversations.
>
> **Notes** -- Try to avoid "processing" things here, as if you start processing
> here you may blow all your time on something that's not the most important.
> Take the approach of a "reporter naming the facts" with a side of "smile/
> laugh at the good bits".

### 2. Possible Agenda

We write a bullet point list of things would **could** talk about. e.g. _Anxiety
about summer plans; How we're sharing house-hunting labour; That fight we had._

**Time** -- 5 min

> **Notes** -- Avoid "processing" here too


### 3. Prioritise

We decide the top 2-3 things we want to discuss today. We tend to ask ourselves
    - are there any quick wins here?
    - are any of these urgent?
    - which of these are most important?

**Time** -- 1-2 min

> **Why** -- It can be tempting to try and cover everything. Invariably if you
> do this, you end up either rushing / pressurising conversations that would
> have benefitted from the reverse (spaciousness / time), or you just run out of
> time and find you've discussed some bike-shed (superficial) topic while
> something really important was missed.
> 
> **Notes** -- Prioritisation is personal, decide together. We like to tick a
> couple easy things off, and maybe 1-2 chunkier topics. If you feel like
> there's not enough space / time for a topic (good noticing!), name it and
> perhaps ask "can we plan to dicsuss that another time?".

### 4. Discuss

We move through prioritized topics one at a time. The aim is to
  - share some context on the topic
  - listen and be curious together about what's going on
  - ask ourselves "what could we try different?"
  - write down what we agreed to as the final step in discussing a topic 

**Time** -- 45 min

> **Notes** -- We keep notes of "actions" (agreed things someone is gonna do, or
> changes in role/ process) in a shared Signal. We check the time and energy
> before launching into another topic -- sometimes changing the priorities to
> fit what's emerged is needed

### 5. Appreciation

We pause, take a breath, then share a bunch of things we appreciate -- about our
partner, our relationship, our life together. One person goes first and runs for
a couple minutes while the other listens, then we switch. We finish with a hug.

**Time** -- 5 min

> **Why** -- This whole process can be quite "problem-solving" heavy, and
> emotionally charged. I usually feel great about the connection and
> problem-solving, but this ensures we finish on a really sweet high.
