<!-- Backstory -->

In 2015 I was working in a social enterprise space, and some people in our crew
started porting some of the process tools used to navigate complex dynamic
projects into the personal-relatinship space. It started with my friends C▦▦▦▦▦▦
and A▦▦▦ deciding to date, and to run that as a series of time-bound
experimentsi -- 1 week, then stop, reflect, decide whether to continue, then
same again at 2, 4, 8 weeks etc.

We laughed about that, but in short order several of us were doing periodic
"retrospectives" on our relationships. Alanna wrote a blog about our process --
[Running Agile Scrum on our Relationship][] (2016). This was picked up by the
Multiamory podcast and they iterated on our recipe, releasing [RADAR][].

We were stoked to hear so many people enjoying this pattern. RADAR is a great
resource, though I want to add a couple things to help make all this feel more
accessible.


## A Primer on Retrospectives

> TL;DR -- continual improvement over perfect plans

Businesses (and relationships) are complex systems in that they have a lot of
moving, deeply inter-related parts, and are embedded in still greater
ecosystems. Navigation in such a context can be really challenging, and there
are a lot of tools which can help. My favourate of these "the feedback loop". 

If we extend the sailing metaphor, a feedback loop is as simple as :
1. Take a bearing -- where are we now?
2. Set a course -- what should we move towards?
3. Sail a bit
4. (repeat)

This doesn't preclude having a long term goal / desired destination, but it does
acknowledge that you're sailing with a certain amount of "unknown", and complex
interactions may mean you find yourself "off-course" and need to adjustments.

What I really want to emphasise is that we discard the impossible ideal of "a perfect
course to desired end" and replace it with "an ongoing journey of improvement".

In software development we often use Scrum / Agile and the feedback loop looks like:
1. Take a bearing -- what have we just built?
2. Set a course -- what should we build next?
3. Build a bit
4. (repeat)

But we ALSO apply the feedback loop to the our team process too (it's part of
the building, why not?):
1. Take a bearing -- how we feeling about that last round?
2. Set a course -- any changes we should make to how we're working?
3. Do a bit
4. (repeat)

In the context of a ship, this would be like a crew evolving their roles/
protocols/ processes e.g. "hey they chef is sick... how about we each take a
turn cooking for the next week?".

Retrospective just means "look back", but it's often used as a short hand for
the process where we get together and "Take a bearing" and "Set a course". 

In an Agile/ Scrum context, there's usually a time/ energy constraint -- once
again, the goal is not perfection, it is to use feedback loops to incrementally
improve over time. As long as you trend in a good direction you're winning. This
means things like
- we may surface 10 issues... but we don't expect to "solve" them all, as long
  as we progress 1 of them in the next sprint, that is progress
- we don't know the the perfect solution to this issue... but we can "try
  something" and see how the system responds... and can try something else next
  time if this doesn't work


## Our Current Process

We run relationship retrospectives once a month (ideally), and set aside 90
minutes for our process. Here are the phases:

### 1. Load Context

10-15 minutes

We look at our calenders, and speak out loud the important landmarks of the past
month.  e.g. _We were all sick for a week! You finished your government
contract. I finally got back to my exercise routine._ 

**Why** -- We're remembering all the things, and aligning our contexts. We are
  focusing on naming things factually, and may bump into or stir up some
  things we want to put in our "Possible Agenda".

**Notes** -- Try to avoid "processing" things here, as if you start processing
here you may blow all your time on something that's not the most important. Take
the approach of a "reporter naming the facts" with a side of "smile/ laugh at
the good bits".


### 2. Possible Agenda

1-2 minutes

We write a bullet point list of things would *could* talk about. e.g. _Anxiety
about summer plans, How we're sharing house-hunting labour, ..._

**Notes** -- Avoid "processing"
