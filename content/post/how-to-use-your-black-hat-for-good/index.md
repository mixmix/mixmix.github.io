I'm a critical thinker. I'm a coder with a background in maths - I excel at
taking ideas and problems apart. The blessing of this is that I understand
systems I work with intimately, perhaps even better than others. The curse is
that some-times my deep-analysis mode presents like "pointing out all the
problems"; a nay-sayer; a devils-advocate.

If you relate to any of things, welcome, I'm writing this for you - you have a
Black Hat. I'm writing this because having a Black Hat is a super-power, and if
you've got one you're probably deploying it sub-optimally. Here are a couple of
easy tweaks to get the most out of it.


## Know when to use it (and keep your friends!) 

In the context of collaboration, I'm fantastic at reviewing, seeing
vulnerabilities, and threats. Historically, I've also generated a lot of
pushback for quashing fledgling ideas, or 'always seeing the negative'.

Looking at [de Bono's thinking
hats](http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm), has been a real
help for me. There are six of them, each representing a different style - or
mode - of thinking, de Bono proposed was that a lot of tension in a groups
emerges from different people being in different modes. (In computer security,
there are also 'hats', try the post-script for a mapping between the colours)

For example in a visioning session, I deploy the Black Hat (critical thinking),
because it's a strength of mine. Meanwhile others in the team are wearing the
Green Hat (generative, exploratory thinking). The combination feels bad,
because most people know that things being suggested aren't perfect - that's
not the point of the exercise at this point - but I'm doing the opposite of
creating, I'm bringing nothing to the table, I'm just cracking the things other
things are bringing open.

The problem is that I'm just leaning on my strengths - this is a common and
lazy habit of Black Hats. If you notice yourself being called a devils
advocate, you've probably fallen into this trap. Generally people don't like
devils advocates and if you persist you're in for a bad time.

This doesn't mean you can't use your hat, just know when to use it - check in
with your group about what 'mode' we're wanting to be in. If we're doing
exploring, lets agree to be Green Hat, and then agree when we're ready to shift
to stress testing the new ideas all at once (with our Black hats).


## How to be think critically AND generatively

This is what I'm most excited about. It's the realisation that you can use you
Black Hat to spot threats or weaknesses, and then put on a Yellow Hat. If the
Black Hat is the destructive critical thinking, the Yellow hat is the
future-facing critical thinking about our values. (This might not have been de
Bono's intention, but bear with me.) 

For example, I'm currently teaching a group of coders at [Dev
Academy](http://www.devacademy.co.nz/). There's this dynamic emerging where 3
of my students are excellent at asking questions. I noticed I was feeling
annoyed, and my Black Hat says "These students are dominating the air-space, to
the exclusion of the quieter students, and to the exclusion of the women in the
group". It goes on "There are gender and societal dynamics at play here, I
wonder in what ways I could be contributing to this?". The solution that comes
from this hats thinking is "You need to tell them to stop asking questions and
tell them we're making the gender gap worse".

While this is kinda the desired outcome and there is truth in it, it lacks
compassion, and sure as hell isn't going to be received well.


By pivoting into my Yellow Hat, I'm able to ask the critical question "In what
ways is falling short of the desired values I want us to be living?" Which
leads to the subtle shift in focus "What are the values I want to be living
here?"

The answer is easy and I kind of already knew it but it was tangled up in my
Black Hat deficit thinking. Clearly resolving "I want everyone to be practising
confident question asking, so they can be well equipped for their career."
meant resolving the situation was a piece of cake. I invited the confident 3 to
a conversation, told them the value I wanted to realise, and invited them to
help me.

> **TL;DR** - applying critical thinking to underlying values (as well as the
> problem) will help you see and communicate more clearly.

The difference between this solution and the Black Hat-only one is that it has
baked into it the aspirational end state. If others don't agree with that
aspiration, that's a fricken fantastic thing to talk about - you're going to
skip out a bunch of painful mis-alignment.
