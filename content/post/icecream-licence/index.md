## Origin

_"How come you get to eat icecream on the couch and I don't"_ my kid asked.
_"Because I have my Icecream Licence!"_. This was intended as a joke but lead to
me outlining the key competencies you have to demonstrate to access this licence:

1. You don't spill icecream on the couch
2. If you do, you notice it
3. You know how to clean spills
4. You actually clean those spills

As of writing this, my oldest has the licence, my youngest has decided they're
not ready for the responsibility yet, and happily eat at the table.

I took the time to outline the requirements because I was exhausted by the
repeat-querying from my kids, and I realised that naming the desired end-state
might would save us all a lot of time in the long-run.


## Reflections

The **Icecream Licence** was bootstrapped directly off the Drivers Licence. In
the case of the car we want people to have agency in their life, and to balance
that freedom with the safety of other citizens. In the case of the
icecream, I want my kids to relax and have fun, AND I want a harmonious house
(one where I'm not yelling *STICKY FINGERS ARGGHH!!!!* nor resentfully sponging
dairy out of soft furnishings).

My ultimate goal is for my kids to be fully autonomous, self-actualizing,
socially integrated humans. There are lot of places freedom is dangerous (to
self and/or others). The "Licence" is a really clear way to support people to
grow into that freedom.

This is very similar to an education context, which works in "qualifications",
often defined by "key competencies" which need to be be demonstrated in some
way. Qualifications are usually used to boundary access to additional course/
programmes/ jobs. Licences are a sort of qualification which often boundary
something dangerous to an individual / group / system.

Qualifications and Licences are both awarded by "authorities" - entities we've
invested with the right to author, and to authorise (extend authorship/
autonomy). There's a clear power dynamic in here, which needs some attention and
care. For myself, I try to keep in mind that my authority is in service of that
longer-term goal - my kids being conscientious authors of their reality.


## Creating Licences

Not everything should be a Licence. However we've found it a very succinct way
to communicate with our kids:
<br />
a) There is something adult or dangerous here :fire:
<br />
b) There is a pathway I'm here to support you on _(when you're ready)_ :heart:

Here's some reflective questions to support you exploring Licences:


### Why are you _really_ blocking your child?

You've probably been giving your child "some reason(s)", but it's likely
truncated because you lacked the time, and your child lacks context. Pause and
unpack it more fully. This provides hints about what your child might
need to learn / master.

_e.g. icecream isn't directly dangerous, but it can attract animals, breed
microbes, damage relationships_


### What does doing this well look like?

You are likely unaware of how many points of context + skills are involved with
some domains. Happily, you you can probably imagine a lot of ways your child
would fail. Use these as pointed to mapping our explicitly the pieces of
knowledge and skills required.


### How do you "fail well" here?

Just because adults "know how to do something" does not mean they nail it every
time. A key aspect of mastery is knowing how to adapt **when** failure occurs -
often this involves sensing failure early, and knowing how to gently correct.

- what does this look like when it goes wrong?
- what are the best options for recovering/ mitigating damage?


### Could this Licence have levels?

How can we practice basics and succeed before adding more context/ complexity/
skills?

_e.g. ice-cream in a bowl, in a cone, with/ without chocolate sauce (see
  Dangerous Goods Licence)_

### What's your policy on Licence revocation?

In our house you can definitely lose your Icecream Licence. Sounds kinda
punitive perhaps, but we've found having clear expectations about what's
involved with a Licence makes it really easy to outline outcomes.

It's totally ok to not want to have responsibility for everything all the time!
If you want to pause on some of those responsibilities, it just means that some
of your freedom/ autonomy may be curtailed. We align power with responsibility
