## About

Protozoa is a Cooperative Company registered in New Zealand. It was established
by 3 friends as a way to work flexibly with great people, on important problems.

Over the course of it's existence Protozoa has run in a bunch of ways to support
these goals:
- full income sharing
- peer mentoring
- supporting immigration from hostile countries (USA)
- accessing mortgages by providing more fiscal legibility to banks easily

I was a founding member of the Cooperative. Over the years many different people
have been contributors or owners we've grown to 5
co-owners.

## Pro Bono work
