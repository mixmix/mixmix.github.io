> ⏳ 2015 -- ongoing <br />

This is the project I have contributed the most to in my life. It's a p2p
replicating database, and a solarpunk community that grew up around and through
it. I've made life-long friends and built bridges spanning almost every
continent and honestly it's a challenge hard to summarize.
