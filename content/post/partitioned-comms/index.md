## The death of a friendship :skull: :seedling:

This pattern was born of the death of a relationship. I helped grow an really
successful open-source project with this person - we grew a community,
distributed grant funds, started a coop, and took on contracts to build products
based on the tech.

The problem that snuck up on us was that our personal communications were
interleavened with our technical (and work) conversations. This was not so
uncommon in my experience from social-enterprise -- we bring our "whole selves"
to the grand project right? Ultimately my friend raised that he was having trouble
distinguishing whether my messages were us connecting as friends or me filing
support tickets. Seeing unread messages from me had started to generate
confusion and I guess anxiety.

We managed to name the problem, but too late. Too much damage had been done and
we were unable to recover. I was gutted -- I was complicit, naive, and deeply
mourned the loss of our friendship. I never wanted to make this mistake again...
and so I started partitioning my comms. As this pattern evolved I noticed new
generative dynamics which I'd not foreseen :seedling:


## Work Chats

These were the first. In Signal I started creating dedicated 1:1 chats to
protect against this mistake. Here's how that looks:

<div class='chats'>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üòÄ</div>
      <div class='title'>Ben</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  If I write something in here it's me writing to Ben as a
  friend. He doesn't need to worry I'm coming at him with some work request, this
  is about us connecting as friends.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details open=true>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üíº</div>
      <div class='title'>Ben/ Mix work</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  Work coordination. If it's out-of-office hours, this can wait.
    </div>

## Family Chats

```
WIP NOTES
- family dreams : @Richard (magic) this was inspired by your "cool activities lucky dip bowl"  you described!
- onlyfans : just me posting cute selfies to my #1 subsciber. Should be luder than it is, but who's got the time


So my partner and I have a range of group-chats which help us categorize/ contextualise our chats. We have things like
- Family Admin - a boring kids logistics channel. important but not very personal
- Family Dreams - a space we plant little hopes + dreams for our future
- Read/ Watch/ Do - a collection place for media/ activities we come across
- OnlyFans - a joke chat which is just me and my wife, it's not as lewd as you'd think, more cute
- Emotional Damage << THIS is a recent addition, and why I'm sharing this in a Clown channel








```

Some of the first partitions I introduced were to clarify...

<div class='chats'>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üè°</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Admin</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  Boring but necessary house + kid stuff. I got scared that this would dominate all
    my communication with my wife. Like the "work" chat above it allows us to protect
    our relationship (somewhat) from the onslaught of logistics.

   </div>
  </details>

  <details open>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon icon-first-aid'>+</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Health Stuff</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  A memory augmenting channel. Dumping observations that are maybe insignificant,
  but could be vital as part of a bigger arc is an easy win. Our whole family health
  is in here, but to give you an idea, here's a slice of one pattern we spotted that
  lead to an escalation in care:

  | Time         | Message                                                                                                                                                     |
  |--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Sep 24, 11pm | \<Daughter\> right ear pain ‚Üí paracetamol                                                                                                                   |
  | Nov 07, 8pm  | \<Daughter\> right ear sore, stopped then started.                                                                                                          |
  | Feb 19, 10am | \<Daughter\> doctor says ear looks ok, referring to ENT                                                                                                     |
  | Mar 12, 2am  | \<Daughter\> woke up with ear pain (left only)<br /> - gave half paracetamol<br /> - may have had some liquid come out (swimming at school, or burst drum?) |
  | Mar 25, 8pm  | \<Daughter\> ear seemed to clear "everything is so loud"                                                                                                    |

  We dump details about night wake-ups (invaluable for handing over care context),
  medicine administered, readings (height/ weight/ blood pressure/ temperature),
  questions for doctors, appointment times, notes from doctors visit.

  Formatting like `name` + `topic/ body area` + `info` make patterns easy to search.
  Timestamps are auto-added (it's a chat).

Emotional Damage is a phrase which comes from
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpq56FmIN4). This channel
started as a venting space for challenging interactions with family. It's
become a space for solidarity, reflection, and has transcended into healthy
processing / transmutation.

Example (non-personal): <br />
_This morning I was taking the trash out, and the bag snagged on the bin as
I lifted it, disgorging all this juicy trash on the floor. I was immediately
crest-fallen (this was just one more damn thing on top of an already rough 24
hours), but then I transmuted it into cosmic humour. It was so bad I was able
to laugh ü§£üò≠_
