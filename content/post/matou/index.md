## About

Mātou ("we are") is a collective that exists to grow the digital infrastructure
needed to support transformational growth for Māori communities. Māori already
have centuries of experience in collective governance of shared resources and
distributed governance. The problem is that most "modern" organisational tools 
on offer are reflections of colonial patterns. See [Conway's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) :

> _Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which
> are copies of the communication structures of these organizations._
> — Melvin E. Conway

In Aotearoa (New Zealand), this means that Māori are currently struggling to
organise collectively (as is their tradition) because most of the tools are
fundamentally propertarian/ individualist/ overly top-down... in short, do not
serve.

The core observation of [Āhau](/p/ahau) ("I am") was that we must start by
rebuilding right tools starting with **identity** -- this is the foundation by
which we know ourselves (through our history, our relationships), and from here
move into coordinating and building new things. Crucially, this **must** be
rooted in absolute sovereignty (no rented domain names, no foreign servers
controlling authorship, no singular source of truth).

As a radical exploration of data-sovereign identity Āhau succeeded in part, but
ultimately surfaced challenges blocking our grand vision:
- identity tools must be **free**... but maintaining them with grants is
  unsustainable
- each community has it's own tikanga (cultural practice), and we cannot (and
  should not) build for all of them
- Limited Liability Company governing an identity commons is a misalignment with
  our [kaupapa](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=kaupapa)

Mātou is being designed to be a multi-stakeholder entity which gives community
real say in the systems being built, fosters ecosystems, acknowledges and
rewards participation, growing wealth for all. Currently we are coordinating
through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/matoucollective) (with the
NZ based [Gift Trust](https://thegifttrust.org.nz/) as a fiscal host), which
lets us work transparently under a charity umbrella.

Some projects we've been involved in recently::
- Supporting the [Whangaroa Papa Hapū](https://whangaroapapahapu.org.nz) towards
  Treaty Settlement with cutting edge, culturally appropriate and resilient
  tools
- R+D on the fusion of millennia of Indigenous collective organising patterns
  with modern DAO tooling
- Partnering with [K'aute Pasifika](https://kautepasifika.co.nz/) to prototype
  data-sovereignty preserving health/ wellbeing systems
- Guiding the [Cardano Constitution](https://constitution.gov.tools/en) process
  -- practising world-scale collective governance
