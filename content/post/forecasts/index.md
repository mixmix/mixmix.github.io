_Although this pattern emerged through the challenges of parenting, I still find
it really useful wherever there is high variability / unknowns in coordination._


## Planning with ~~kids~~ _chaos_

When I had kids, organising hang-outs went from pretty simple to something much
more unstable. For example _"let's meet at the zoo at 2pm"_... sounds easy
enough, but then toddlers don't necessarily sleep on an exact schedule, and
there is a greater than zero chance someone could spew in the car on the way
there. Multiply these unknowns by the number of participants and it can be
pretty easy for plans to only semi-align, or totally bomb.

This can generate feelings that range from _mild stess_ (am I waiting for X to
arrive before we go into the zoo?) through to _total bummer_ (I was really
looking forward to an adult conversation). A particularly painful failure mode
is the "after bedtime han-gout" where no children are present (read: **this is
my time off**), where some kid need arises, you are wrenched back into duty, and
your plans are cancelled. Deep expectation-reality whiplash.

If your plans involved other people with limited resources, you're probably
also carrying the cost to the group in mind e.g. their expectation-reality
whiplash, and the cost of having the try to re-schedule a hang out.


## Decomposing the problem

I noticed the crux of the pain for me was the sharp divergence of reality from
expectation. Why was this happening? I think because my internal narrative was
too binary, that is only had two modes:
- `hangin out` ⇒ :smile:
- `no hangs` ⇒ :sob:.

What if we told a story which was more nuanced... reduce the surprise of the
flip between these states. Could we take in all the variables, name and
acknowledged the uncertainty, and build our story on that? Sounds like it might
be too complex, but you've seen this pattern before ⇒ weather forecasts!

So I started experimenting with a friend I play
[Magic](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/peach?view=spoiler) with. Our
conversations shifted from being more of a rollercoaster: 

> **Mix** : How are things looking for a game tonight? <br />
> **Eric** : :+1: Yeah I'm on! See you at 8pm <br />
>   ... <br />
> **Mix** : 😕 you coming? <br />
> **Eric** : 👀 yep, just running a little late... <br />
>   ... <br />
> **Eric** : 😔 Look I'm really sorry, I gotta cancel, child spewing<br />
> **Mix** : 😭 oh no! good luck


To a really smooth expectation ride:

> **Mix** : How are things looking for a game tonight? <br />
> **Eric** : ☔ 30%, my youngest has a cold, stay tuned! <br />
> **Mix** : ❤️‍🩹 No pressure this end<br />
> **Mix** : ✨ Let me know if the stars align! Otherwise catch you another night


## Updated forecast

One of the joys of this is that just like a weather forecast, your forecast of 
the likelihood of a date working out can evolve over time:

- ⛈️  40% we have quite a few [lemons](/p/lemons) on deck
- ☁️  60% grandma said she can take a kid!
- ☀️  85% sick child is asleep 🙌🤞

If you want you can front-load a little context about the lemons (complexity/
challenges) that are introducing uncertainty, then subsequent updates can be really
brief, even just "20%".

Contrast this with trying to protect people from complexity (not wanting to
prematurely complicate or worry), but then feeling pressure to offer apologies,
AND explanation, AND **in the exact moment of some disaster unfolding** :-1:.


## Commitment + Context

One thing I immediately noticed was that communicating this way seperated our
commitment to the relationship from the challenges of our context.

In the past I feel like generally people wanted to make a plan work -- to honour
the organising + time people have contributed, the relationship -- and that to
cancel plans felt like some damage that needed acknowledgment and repair.

Now I it's really easy for me to say:
1. :heart: I would love to hang out with you! (commitment)
2. ⛈️  60%, here's what I'm working with (context)

My commitment + context can now be expressed orthogonally 🤓. It feels like it
unlocks a lot more compassion / kindness, which is especially helpful for anyone
navigating relationships intersecting with complexity, be that kids, mental
health challenges, disability etc.
