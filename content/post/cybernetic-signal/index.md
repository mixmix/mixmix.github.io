## Origins :skull: :seedling:

These patterns were born of the death of a friendship. TL;DR we muddled
personal and work comms to the point where communication got confused, and
trust broke down. We managed to name the problem, but too late to be able to
recover. I was gutted -- I was naive, complicit, and had lost a dear friend. My
response was to start partitioning my comms, obsessively asking:

**What is the best space to relay this message into?**

Over time this query has evolved
how I think and relate. Please enjoy a sampler of how I use Signal, presented
as an explorable simulacrum -- _click in to read more about those you're
curious about._

## Work Chats

These were the first. In Signal I started creating dedicated 1:1 chats to
protect against this mistake. Here's how that looks:

<div class='chats'>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üòÄ</div>
      <div class='title'>Ben</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  If I write something in here it's me writing to Ben as a
  friend. He doesn't need to worry I'm coming at him with some work request, this
  is about us connecting as friends.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details open=true>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üíº</div>
      <div class='title'>Ben/ Mix work</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  Work coordination. If it's out-of-office hours, this can wait.
    </div>
  </details>

## Family Chats

Another reason I shifted hard into more exobrain use is also that having babies
turned my endobrain into mush. Gotta record everything or it's gone. Here are
some chat groups that are just me and my partner -- our collective memory,
sense-making, and futuring.

<div class='chats'>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üè°</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Admin</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  Boring but necessary house + kid stuff. I got scared that this would dominate all
  my communication with my partner. Like the "work" chat above it allows us to protect
  our relationship (somewhat) from the onslaught of logistics.

   </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon icon-first-aid'>+</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Health Stuff</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  A memory augmenting channel. Dumping observations that are maybe insignificant,
  but could be vital as part of a bigger arc is an easy win. Our whole family health
  is in here, but to give you an idea, here's a slice of one pattern we spotted that
  lead to an escalation in care:

  | Time         | Message                                                                                                                                        |
  |--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Sep 24, 11pm | \<Daughter\> right ear pain ‚Üí paracetamol                                                                                                      |
  | Nov 07, 8pm  | \<Daughter\> right ear sore, stopped then started.                                                                                             |
  | Feb 19, 10am | \<Daughter\> doctor says ear looks ok, referring to ENT                                                                                        |
  | Mar 12, 2am  | \<Daughter\> woke with ear pain (left only)<br /> - gave half paracetamol<br /> - may have had some liquid come out (swimming, or burst drum?) |
  | Mar 25, 8pm  | \<Daughter\> ear seemed to clear "everything is so loud"                                                                                       |

  We dump details about night wake-ups (invaluable for handing over care context),
  medicine administered, readings (height/ weight/ blood pressure/ temperature),
  questions for doctors, appointment times, notes from doctors visit.

  **Format** -- `name` + `topic/ body area` + `info` <br />
  Makes patterns easy to search. Timestamps are essential, but auto-added by chat.

   </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üåà</div>
      <div class='title'>Read/ Watch</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  A record of books / films / series that we've encountered and would like to
  queue up. Raw titles alone means you lose the context for _why_ this caught your
  attention, so I'd recommend a format like:

 `title` + `genre` + `link?` + `why?`
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üéâ</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Dreams</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- My friend Richard and his partner have a bowl of cards, and on the cards
  are written fun activities. When they're bored they pull a card from the bowl, and
  they're off on adventure. I copied that. When my partner or I come across a recommended
  location, fun kids activity, or upcoming event, they get dumped into this chat.

  **Evolution** -- It's like a shared memory space... but for for possible futures. This
  chat has increased our capacity for bringing dreams into the world. We started at
  simple (_Real Fruit Ice-cream_), and have grown in scale (_International trip with
  another family_), and depth (_Take a night-class to explore this shy aspect of myself_).

  I cannot recommend this pattern enough.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon icon-double'>üí¨ üòÖ</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Quotes</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- We have two young kids and wanted to remember some of the crack-up things
  they've said.

  | Time   | Message                                                                                                                        |
  |--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Jan 14 | **Son** : I have the opposite program to most people. I have my dreams while I'm awake instead of while I'm sleeping.          |
  | Apr 19 | **Daughter** : I feel bad, like I hurt someone... but it's just that I fell in love with tacos                                 |
  | Apr 21 | **Daughter** : hey I'm following you, you're the role model<br />**Grandma**: don't follow me -- I don't know where I'm going! |

  **Evolution** -- One of the greatest gift kids offer is the chance to see the world
  afresh. Their observations are uncoloured by idioms, uncluttered by... 'grown up'
  context? Their questions side-step social norms and drive (unknowing or sensing?)
  into the heart of things. We're invited to reflect on our assumptions, our knowledge,
  what we really values, and to summarise those thoughts in under 2mins in simple terms.

  </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>ü•µ</div>
      <div class='title'>Only Fans</div>

      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- started as a joke chat. I added my partner and posted a couple cute selfies.

  | Time   | Message                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
  |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Jan 24 | This chat is being repurposed frow sfw duckface selfies to things I love about our life and want to remember to share with you                                                                                                                        |
  | Mar 2  | **mix** : "remind me about leadership call"?! <br /> **partner** : thanks! I scheduled that message 5 days ago, you're like my meatware in this situation <br /> **mix** : I am your meatware, that's what we signed up for <br /> **partner** : awww |

  **Evolution** -- reflecting on what having a "premium subscription" might mean,
  I noticed this channel was a perfect place to post post celebrations of beauty
  we see unfolding in our lives, appreciation of one another, and the occasional
  insights from therapy.

    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>T_T</div>
      <div class='title'>Emotional Damage</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- Inspired by this [comedy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpq56FmIN4),
  this started as a high-context, high-trust channel for my partner and I to 
  vent about those cringe or painful moments in life.

  **Evolution** -- Laughing together at a predicament is a quick way to affirm
  shared values and step away from any fight/flight/freeze/fawn response.
  If it's not funny, then we can move into more careful support of each other.
  Whatever the path, stabilisation/ alignment/ destressing make it easier to
  engage curiosity, name the kernel of any conflict, explore upstream solutions,
  etc.

  My partner and I run monthly relationship retrospectives. You can read
  about that pattern [here](https://alannairving.medium.com/running-agile-scrum-on-our-relationship-9b2085c5d747),
  and evolutions of our process on the Multiamory podcast
  [[1]](https://www.multiamory.com/podcast/97-agile-relationships)
  [[2]](https://www.multiamory.com/podcast/147-relationship-radar-scrum-20)
  !

  This is a simple shared memory archive. When we decide on an iteration
  of something we'd like to try out, we record it here. This helps us
  loop back to reflect on how experiments have gone. Later this will likely
  enable us to reflect on what we continue to struggle with, how far we've
  come, and what our relationship is.
