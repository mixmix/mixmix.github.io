## Composting Friendship :skull: :seedling:

This pattern was born of the death of a friendship. I helped grow an really
successful open-source project with this friend -- community, grants funds,
co-founding a co-op, authoring specs, contracting together.

The problem that snuck up on us was that our personal communications were
interleaved with our technical (and work) conversations. This was not so
uncommon in my experience from social-enterprise -- we bring our "whole selves"
to the grand project right? Ultimately my friend raised that he was having trouble
distinguishing whether my messages were us connecting as friends or me filing
support tickets. Seeing unread messages from me had started to generate
confusion and anxiety.

We managed to name the problem, but too late to be able to recover. I was gutted
-- I was complicit, naive, and deeply mourned the loss of our friendship. I never
wanted to make this mistake again... and so I started partitioning my comms.
As this pattern evolved I noticed new generative dynamics which I'd not foreseen.


## Work Chats

These were the first. In Signal I started creating dedicated 1:1 chats to
protect against this mistake. Here's how that looks:

<div class='chats'>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üòÄ</div>
      <div class='title'>Ben</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  If I write something in here it's me writing to Ben as a
  friend. He doesn't need to worry I'm coming at him with some work request, this
  is about us connecting as friends.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details open=true>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üíº</div>
      <div class='title'>Ben/ Mix work</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  Work coordination. If it's out-of-office hours, this can wait.
    </div>

## Family Chats

Some of the first partitions I introduced were to clarify...
WIP

<div class='chats'>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üè°</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Admin</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  Boring but necessary house + kid stuff. I got scared that this would dominate all
    my communication with my wife. Like the "work" chat above it allows us to protect
    our relationship (somewhat) from the onslaught of logistics.

   </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon icon-first-aid'>+</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Health Stuff</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  A memory augmenting channel. Dumping observations that are maybe insignificant,
  but could be vital as part of a bigger arc is an easy win. Our whole family health
  is in here, but to give you an idea, here's a slice of one pattern we spotted that
  lead to an escalation in care:

  | Time         | Message                                                                                                                                        |
  |--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Sep 24, 11pm | \<Daughter\> right ear pain ‚Üí paracetamol                                                                                                      |
  | Nov 07, 8pm  | \<Daughter\> right ear sore, stopped then started.                                                                                             |
  | Feb 19, 10am | \<Daughter\> doctor says ear looks ok, referring to ENT                                                                                        |
  | Mar 12, 2am  | \<Daughter\> woke with ear pain (left only)<br /> - gave half paracetamol<br /> - may have had some liquid come out (swimming, or burst drum?) |
  | Mar 25, 8pm  | \<Daughter\> ear seemed to clear "everything is so loud"                                                                                       |

  We dump details about night wake-ups (invaluable for handing over care context),
  medicine administered, readings (height/ weight/ blood pressure/ temperature),
  questions for doctors, appointment times, notes from doctors visit.

  **Format** -- `name` + `topic/ body area` + `info` <br />
  Makes patterns easy to search. Timestamps are essential, but auto-added by chat.

   </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üåà</div>
      <div class='title'>Read/ Watch</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  A record of books / films / series that we've encountered and would like to
  queue up. Raw titles alone means you lose the context for _why_ this caught your
  attention, so I'd recommend a format like:

 `title` + `genre` + `link?` + `why?`
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>üéâ</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Dreams</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- My friend Richard and his partner have a bowl of cards, and on the cards
  are written fun activities. When they're bored they pull a card from the bowl, and
  they're off on adventure. I copied that. When my wife or I come across a recommended
  location, fun kids activity, or upcoming event, they get dumped into this chat.

  **Evolution** -- It's like a shared memory space... but for for possible futures. This
  chat has increased our capacity for bringing dreams into the world. We started at
  simple (_Real Fruit Ice-cream_), and have grown in scale (_International trip with
  another family_), and depth (_Take a night-class to explore this shy aspect of myself_).

  I cannot recommend this pattern enough.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon icon-double'>üí¨ üòÖ</div>
      <div class='title'>Family Quotes</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- We have two young kids and wanted to remember some of the crack-up things
  they've said.

  | Time   | Message                                                                                                                        |
  |--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Jan 14 | **Son** : I have the opposite program to most people. I have my dreams while I'm awake instead of while I'm sleeping.          |
  | Apr 19 | **Daughter** : I feel bad, like I hurt someone... but it's just that I fell in love with tacos                                 |
  | Apr 21 | **Daughter** : hey I'm following you, you're the role model<br />**Grandma**: don't follow me -- I don't know where I'm going! |

  **Evolution** -- One of the greatest gift kids offer is the chance to see the world
  afresh. Their observations are uncoloured by idioms, uncluttered by... 'grown up'
  context? Their questions side-step social norms and drive (unknowing or sensing?)
  into the heart of things. We're invited to reflect on our assumptions, our knowledge,
  what we really values, and to summarise those thoughts in under 2mins in simple terms.

  </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>ü•µ</div>
      <div class='title'>Only Fans</div>
      <div class='note'>(not lewd)</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- a joke chat I set up for my #1 subscriber (my wife). In practice just
  me sending cute selfies.

  **Evolution** -- WIP
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <div class='icon'>T_T</div>
      <div class='title'>Emotional Damage</div>
      <div class='expand-symbol'>+</div>
    </summary>
    <div class='body'>

  **Origin** -- interacting with our families sometimes results in _emotional
  damage_ (see [comedy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpq56FmIN4)).
  Started as a high-context, high-trust channel for my wife and I venting about
  interactions which were cringe or hurt.

  **Evolution** -- I'm aware it might sound nasty, but sharing the experience 
  of suffering shifted something. Laughing together at a predicament is a 
  quick was to affirm shared values and step away from any fight/flight response.
  If it's not funny, then we can move into more careful support of each other.
  Whatever the path, stabilisation/ alignment/ distressing make it easier to 
  engage curiosity (about ourselves, our loved ones, how we relate), name the 
  kernel of a conflict, explore upstream solutions, etc.

  We use this channel now to support any ongoing interpersonal challenges -
  family, work, community, friendships. Sometimes it's just sharing general
  suffering to defuse it.

  | Time   | Message                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

  | Nov 22 | This morning I was taking the trash out and the bag snagged, disgorging all this juicy trash all over the floor. I was crest-fallen (just one more damn thing on top of an already rough 24 hours), but then I transmuted it into cosmic humour. It was so bad I was able to laugh ü§£ üò≠ |
