&lt;p>Beautiful Signals is an event series engaging art practices and a series of
self-run workshops that explore emerging issues with soil, food, data,
democracy and digital sovereignty&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This was a project brought together by an emerging group of Pōneke activists/
programmers/ artists/ community organisers. I helped pull the website together,
and also hosted a workshop on &lt;a class="link" href="https://beautifulsignals.nz/workshops/maori_data_sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Māori Data
Sovereignty&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

whom I met through Scuttlebutt and Dweb Camp work. We wanted to continue
connecting, learning from one another, and to build more centres for connection
beyond the one we&amp;rsquo;d mostly been gathering around in California.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decent Social was a 24 hour rolling conference that spanned 3 timezones
(Asia-Pacific, Africa-Europe, and Americas). We (the organising team) put a lot
of work in making the event accessible, and safe for participants. I was the
regional host for Asia-Pacific, and on call for any moderation or Code of

&lt;p>⏳ 2015 &amp;ndash; 2017 &lt;br />&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My experience of the potential of what education &lt;em>can&lt;/em> be through working at
&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited" >Unlimited&lt;/a> radicalised me to the point where I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I
would ever work in an educational institution again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="precursor">Precursor
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After leaving teaching for the first time, I went to art school, and happened to
come into contact with some nerds also hacking on community in a different way
(&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.enspiral.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Enspiral&lt;/a>). As a summer experiment, Josh Vial
mentored a group of people in how to code. (This may have been the &lt;em>alpha&lt;/em>
cohort foreshadowing Dev Academy.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left art school, joined &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/loomio" >Loomio&lt;/a>, and extended my radical (i.e.
anarchist) teaching skills into the space of collective organising,
facilitation, and agile development. I did a range of contracts through a
collective called CraftWorks (also part of Enspiral).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="teaching-programming">Teaching Programming
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Having validated an opportunity for a different sort of tertiary eduction around
programming, Josh Vial and Rohan Wakefield launched Dev Academy. The format was
something like a remote prep course, follow by a 9-week long in person
intensive course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was invited to do mentoring for the early cohorts, and ultimately moved into
full time teaching. The teaching team in our era ran somewhat autonomously - we
created and evolved curriculum, hired our own staff, and coordinated with the
rest of the organisation.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Teaching&amp;rdquo; at Dev Academy was similar and different to Unlimited. Everyone on
the course had explicitly chosen and opted in to this very specific pathway.
It was incredibly intense - the amount of ground we covered over 9 weeks was&amp;hellip;
quite like being thrown in the deep end, relentless. However we coupled the
technicalities of the conceptual code learning with an strong structure of
personal support - teaching personal reflection, interpersonal communication
tools, and providing close mentoring and counselling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; once again seeing the humans holistically, treating learning as a deeply
personal journey (not just an exercise in content) - of relationship with
yourself and with others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="legacy">Legacy
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It was at Dev Academy that I met Piet Geursen. We formed and enduring
relationship through teaching and leading together, and went on to found
a cooperative together - &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/protozoa" >Protozoa&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I supported several friends into careers programming through Dev Academy.
Some of them are now coop members too! &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/ahau" >Āhau&lt;/a> + &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/matou" >Mātou&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> What a waste of potential

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>There&amp;rsquo;s a chance I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s my story if you want to parse it yourself.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="school">School
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As an inquisitive (and naive) teenager, I judged IT largely by what was offered at school.
Touch typing, some HTML maybe, but none of the really beautiful stuff.
The offering was boring and unchallenging compared to centuries-old maths and sciences.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="university">University
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My inquiry led me to study neuroscience, which turned out to be a bit too
reductionist to practically help me understand people (so western!). I graduated
as a mathematician, and after failing as a post-graduate research assistant
(modelling blood splatter of blunt weapon trauma), I took a government subsidy
to train as a teacher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d really enjoyed tutoring at university, but found that my higher education on
education guided me into surprisingly unsavoury amounts of acting (playing some
authoritarian role) and crowd control (learning tricks to manipulate group
social dynamics to maintain control).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about the length of hair or the height of socks. Quiet (but
noticed) protest looked like attending careers day and meeting prospective
school principals in ripped jeans. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother attending my graduation (NOTE&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>going off piste often requires more paperwork later).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The irony of teaching engaging learning in a lecture format was a laugh, but the
university did introduce me to &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited" >Ao Tawhiti Unlimited Discovery&lt;/a> -
the only high school I would take a job at. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t an act of rebelion, more
an extension of my stubornness and pickiness (which I was rich enough to be able
to afford).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was so attractive about Unlimited was the atmosphere (or people dynamics).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited" >Unlimited&lt;/a> is a state funded public secondary school that exists
because of a loophole in the law, which allowed the bending of a rule meant for
the integration of church schools into a rule which allowed the school to write
its own assessment rules. Its &amp;ldquo;special character&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;a fundamental tenet that
the child is central in directing his or her own learning so that the enthusiasm
and love of learning is retained.&amp;rdquo; My kind of place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can talk a lot about what made that environment transformative, but I think
the key was radically more equal power dynamics. As a Learning Advisor there, I
didn&amp;rsquo;t assert authority through enforcing arbitrary rules. I had conversations
on a first name-basis with people about what they cared about in life. Classes
didn&amp;rsquo;t have age-barriers, and students could choose what they wanted to do every
5 weeks. Instead of segregation and age-based hierarchy, there was conversation
and experiementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt good. People were kind (not to be confused with nice), and they learnt a
lot. Instead of negotiating bullying and claustrophobia, students spent their
time doing things like attending university level classes, running New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s
only OpenDNS server from a bedroom, and working together to support a friend
with depression. Some of the experiences moved me so deeply I still cry when I
recall them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most state education is missing the mark by a wide margin. It makes me
thoroughly sad - and angry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="art-school">Art School
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I loved Unlimited, and learnt an enourmous amount there, but I left to stretch
skills outside of teaching. There was also a massive earthquake that destroyed
the city. I moved to attend art school, where I got into programming the laser
cutter (which I was shocked to find almost no one else was using).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was the worst adult student - I know what good education looks like, and I
like giving feedback. The context and tools were great but the educators
(outside of the pure theorists) were weak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left and did some relief teaching where I tried to treat students as equals. I
was horrified to discover that the acting I&amp;rsquo;d disliked in state teaching is a
two part play, and exiting a play is hard when the other actors are continually
asserting your role. Genuine conversation was overridden by a race to establish
dominance and control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="social-enterprise">Social Enterprise
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over a summer break I was introduced to Joshua Vial who taught me (and several
others) to be web developers. I took these skills and helped build Loomio (an
open source collaborative decision-making tool).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.loomio.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Loomio&lt;/a> - and the garden-nebula Enspiral
within which it grew - were the next group of most excellent people I met. This
is where I was introduced more explicitly to a discourse around power.&lt;/p>

coding bootcamp that trains non-technical people to become junior web developers
in 9 weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s a synthesis of my interests to date - programming, learning,
and community building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I take myself, and those around me to and beyond the limit of our technical
ability. The only way you can do that effectively and get anything out of it is
to be super up-front about what you do and don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="power-and-knowledge">Power and Knowledge
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not knowing things for some reason brings up shame for people. The most
dangerous thing for a student is self-doubt, and sitting on shame is a good way
to get that. This is another topic I&amp;rsquo;m currently really interested in, and will
write more on some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that might be a study in itself, but I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in how &lt;em>not
knowing&lt;/em> plays out for teachers, because I believe this is the reason I&amp;rsquo;m not
currently an ascendant cyber-wizard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you don&amp;rsquo;t know a thing as a teacher, a &lt;strong>very interesting&lt;/strong> decision path
emerges:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A) lie&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B) admit you don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-would-you-lie">Why would you lie?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Well, if your position as teacher is predicated on your knowing more, being the
&lt;em>source of truth&lt;/em>, then not knowing might seem to undermine that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The average high-school teacher is in a surprisingly precarious power-position -
it might look like they have control, but only through carefully guided consent
of the class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a teacher in a position where their authority is coupled to their knowledge,
it is awfully appealing to steer conversation away from topics which might erode
that position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this is why classes on computers suck so bad in high school - they are
born of institution, which is established in such as a way as to bind teaching
to the bounds of individual mastery, which is finite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Education around computers offer a unique window into the future of learning.
The field is moving so fast, that &lt;strong>the only reasonable path is to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t
know&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> a lot. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, then talking about new and relevant ideas won&amp;rsquo;t be
part of your curriculum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many educational institutions, saying I don&amp;rsquo;t know is not safe for educators.
Generally they are in systems that give them positional authority to solve the
&amp;lsquo;behaviour management&amp;rsquo; problems. They are generally not afforded humanising
tools of social safety, like building genuine relationships, or sharing
vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does everyone trapped in that dynamic a huge disservice. Both teachers and
students achieve less understanding, less empathy, less collaboration, less
critical thinking, etc. The learning is poorer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="not-knowing-as-power">Not knowing as Power
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Being able to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is the beginning of some fantastic cascading effects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>reveals &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;teachers&amp;rsquo; both as learners&lt;/li>
&lt;li>opportunity to model good learning
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>critical thinking/problem solving (process over rote learning)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>asking for help&lt;/li>
&lt;li>listening&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shows teacher as human, relatable
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>more trust, less lying&lt;/li>
&lt;li>more humanistic dynamic, better conversations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>drop shame, move to a growth mindset&lt;/li>
&lt;li>go beyond boring &amp;lsquo;safe&amp;rsquo; topics
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>interesting, inspiring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>engaging (perhaps people like me 15 years ago)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>play&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is how I see power dynamics hampering our learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m investing in education systems which set aside positional authority, and
foster environments in which it&amp;rsquo;s safe for everyone to be vulnerable. For older
systems, I&amp;rsquo;m building an evolving book format, designed to open education
resources and support teachers to transition from authorities to guides and
catalysts of learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be working in a community which is supporting me to develop a
different sort of learning pattern for myself. Maybe if we&amp;rsquo;re lucky (and
persistent), we can shift learning patterns more broadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to hear from anyone else playing the long game of reshaping
education.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/unlimited/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti" />&lt;blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I enjoyed working as a tutor when I was at uni, so after some sloppy (failed)
post-grad maths research on blood splatter analysis, I decided to try out
teaching. The training was pretty meh, but I wandered into a skype call with
this place called Unlimited (some polytechnic or something?), anyway young
people telling us about producing albums, making video games, managing their own
time and talking like mature adults. Towards the end of the call it turned out
we&amp;rsquo;d been talking to high school students as young as 14. I asked for a placement
there, and after doing practicum in the sort of place where people gave a fuck
about other people and supported actual learning I refused to take a job
anywhere else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I lived in Christchurch for 4 years and, and worked with some wonderful
learning advisors and some amazing young people.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a trainee teacher in a maths class, there&amp;rsquo;s a student swinging on their
chair and looking out the window. Here&amp;rsquo;s the dialogue between the learning
advisor (Duncan) and the student (Hamish)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Duncan&lt;/strong>: Hey Hamish, looks like you&amp;rsquo;re not getting much done&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hamish&lt;/strong> : Nah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this big event coming up this week which I&amp;rsquo;m
thinking about (sport/ music? I can&amp;rsquo;t remember)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Duncan&lt;/strong>: Oh that&amp;rsquo;s cool! What&amp;rsquo;s that about?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;hellip; 5 minutes of genuine conversation about shit that matters in Hamish&amp;rsquo;s life&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Duncan&lt;/strong>: Hey, so it sounds like you&amp;rsquo;ve got a bunch on. If you want to go
have a nap or read a book under that tree, we can catch up on your maths
later. Or if you&amp;rsquo;d like to give the maths a go, we&amp;rsquo;ve got another 15 minutes
left of this class.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Things that stood out clear as day to me :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>no bullshit authoritarianism, i.e. I was expecting &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;DONT swing on your chair,
GET BACK into focus!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> (teacher training taught me that ~ 50% of the job is
coercion / crowd control / acting)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the &amp;lsquo;student&amp;rsquo; was open and honest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it was an even mature conversation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the outcome was awesome, everyone won (was respected, and supporting the
student&amp;rsquo;s learning was 100% nailed)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="real-learning">Real learning
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Later, when I was an Learning Advisor (official role title, re-centres
&amp;ldquo;teachers&amp;rdquo; as supporters, facilitators, mentors), I had a group of students
who&amp;rsquo;d chosen to work with me (mostly nerds). On of them (Harley) was keen to go
skiing.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Harley&lt;/strong>: hey Mix, can we go skiing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong>: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to take you skiing if you figure out all the
logistics and safety and stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Harley&lt;/strong>: &amp;hellip; ok, what do I need to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong>: I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but we could talk to Peter, he does mountaineering
courses and knows how to do risk assessments or whatever&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we went skiing. Responsibility was shared, Harley and friends learnt how to
budget, plan, and coordinate. We did similar things all the time, like making a
~VR headset with wii controllers, and building a RepRap (3d printer&amp;hellip; this one
got interrupted by the quake).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="everyone-is-a-teacher-everyone-is-a-learner">Everyone is a teacher, everyone is a learner
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Every wednesday afternoon the whole school would stop and do some sort of
exercise. The most minimal one was &lt;em>Walking&lt;/em> - we&amp;rsquo;d walk through the CBD and
around the gardens of Hagley Park (Christchurch has a huge central park). My
first time out, I lost like 60% of the students, and was freaking out. When I
got back, my supervising teacher said &amp;ldquo;oh yeah, they&amp;rsquo;ll have just walked home,
it&amp;rsquo;s fine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later I ended up taking kids who wanted to go skateboarding to the skate park. I
didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to skate at the time, and one day one of them said &amp;ldquo;Hey Mix,
you should learn how to drop in on the half-pipe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of me was like &lt;em>NOPE&lt;/em> but the other part of me was like &amp;ldquo;You gotta do this,
it&amp;rsquo;s really important you role model incompetence and perseverance in
learning&amp;rdquo;. So they taught me very kindly and patiently how to skate. After a
month of this, we&amp;rsquo;d built a bunch of trust and the boys were asking what other
classes I took and genuinely sounded open to checking out stuff they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
otherwise have been into. You can grow curiosity. Relationships matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The school had a core mantra: &lt;strong>everyone is a teacher, everyone is a learner&lt;/strong>.
This story kinda sums that up for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Students also taught me to how to &amp;#x1f512; pick locks, &amp;#x1f355; trade Bitcoin for
pizza, &amp;#x1f697; change the oil on my car, etc.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="earthquakes">Earthquakes
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At the time of the quake, I was 2 blocks from the city centre, on my way to a
teachers union meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Major traumatic events do weird things to your perception and memory. I don&amp;rsquo;t
remember how long the quake was (it was 30s to 2 minutes?), but I do remember
thinking I was having some sort of brain breakdown, or drugs, or .. my vision
was fucked. The trees - giant oaks - were melting and waving &amp;hellip; so were the
lamp-posts. When the rolling stopped, I wondered if it had been a bomb. Where
before there was a block of buildings on one side of the park there was a
building sized cloud of dust&amp;hellip;.. it was a totally opaque wall of dust rising
into the sky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, I paused before wondering if I should go back to the school -
maybe fuck everyone else? I figured trying carefully might be ok. By this time
the half dozen teachers I had been walking with, only 2 were still there. I
don&amp;rsquo;t know where everyone went. For sure those with children of their own left
without pause at top speed. As we made our way back towards the school (a 4
storey building on the other side of the city square, 3 blocks away), we passed
people saying things like &amp;ldquo;The Cathedral is down&amp;rdquo;. Not being inclined to
investigate, the 3 of us set out to go the long way round. One of us decided to
cut through an arcade with a glass roof. I chose to take another street. There
wasn&amp;rsquo;t much discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found two of my students in togs (swim-suits) with towels. I told them to put
their shoes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we passed through taller buildings, there were sounds like rubble and glass
falling, and hissing &amp;hellip; like broken water mains, or was it gas? I had a weird
echo of experience playing FPS games &amp;ndash; I knew the rules, it was DO NOT stand
still, keep your head, and keep moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having people to look after helps a lot. As we walked there were people all
walking around on the road. Some were moving quickly, others were consoling
people crying. There were also people just standing and staring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We found a train of students exiting the central city, being guided by teachers
(there were only 4 adults in the school of 400 over the lunch because of the
union meeting). I become a redirection node, like in that classic game
lemmings. I found myself directing adults who were wandering as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ultimately joined the train, and made our way to a nearby park. As we went,
the students in the towels (I think?) asked me &amp;ldquo;are those people ok?&amp;rdquo;. I said I
didn&amp;rsquo;t know, and that we needed to keep moving. I was later told we walked past
people bleeding from injuries, and past bodies being pulled from the rubble. We
also walked passed a film studio where my girlfriends flatmate worked. It was
flat. Of the 4-5 storeys, there was nothing but the stairwell. He died in there,
along with dozens of others. I remember seeing that, and the noxious smoke
coming out of the rubble, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember seeing any dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to the small park (2 small city blocks in size), and started to try to
take stock. I understand more how and why the Romans organised they did (under
standards/flags, with command-tents, and information runners). It was pretty
chaotic. Try organising ~400 people with no spatial physical system. Hierarchy
and layers of responsibility become really valuable. Over time a triage centre
and helipad were set up down one end of the park. I stayed till dark as friends
and family picked up children. We took food from the nearby supermarket I think?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I met up with my girlfriend, we walked through the deserted streets. Down one
street cars were half sunk into the road like the ground was quicksand
(liquefaction).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if my house was still standing. The tunnel to Lyttelton was
closed. The next day, 4 of us decided to risk driving over the hill. We passed a
house that had a hole the size of a truck through the middle where a boulder had
passed straight through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our old wooden flat was fine, but there was no running water for days. We shat
in plastic bags for a bit, but soon dug a shit pit to squat in. There was a huge
tanker of water brought in and parked down in the center of our little town. You
could go get buckets or bottles filled down there. Civilisation gets pretty
intense pretty quick without water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll write about the damage to the social fabric later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-learning">More learning
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I stayed a year (or more?) after the quake. The school was seriously disrupted
(moved half-way across the city, sharing with another school), my relationship
broke up, I did some therapy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in my 20s, and I&amp;rsquo;d just poured 4 years of my life and soul into lifting
up others learning and lives. I wanted to do some of that for myself, so I
decided to move to Wellington and attend Art School.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reflections">Reflections
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I think Unlimited did a great job of wrapping support and guidance around
students. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an environment which worked for everyone. I think if I was
to change one thing given years of perspective, it would be to weave more
collectivism into the spirit of the place &amp;ndash; extend the focus beyond &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s my
learning pathway?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> towards &lt;em>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;what can we achieve together?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlimited forever changed how I see institutions and learning. I was
radicalised&amp;hellip; am now forever an advocate for holistic education, of systems
which embed care. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change a thing about that, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a
heart-breaking burden to bear sometimes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
