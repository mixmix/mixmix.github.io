&lt;p>The cellular network is great, AND you should expect it to be disrupted. Cell
towers require a lot of power, and intact data/phone lines. If one goes down,
others take on more load, and when everyone is over-loading networks trying
to connect, they&amp;rsquo;re even less reliable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; what do we do?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mesh-networks">Mesh Networks
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A mesh network is made up of many devices, each of which can talk to it&amp;rsquo;s
neighbour. In a mesh network you can get a message across the city by passing
it through a series of peers. The good news is there&amp;rsquo;s already an active mesh
in Wellington, and joining it will only make communication more resilient.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some interesting things to note about this mesh network&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>what a mess!&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; correct, this is mostly an uncoordinated (ad-hoc)
network. It evolves over time as nodes move, turn on/ off. Messages just take
the paths that are open and it mostly &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>how come some line are real long?&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; some devices are on top of mountains,
and/ or have special antennas, which means signals can jump further (like the
top of the South Island).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>isn&amp;rsquo;t revealing your location a security risk&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; Yes! Not all devices opt
into broadcasting their position, i.e. there are likely more devices in the mesh
that pictured. I believe you can also choose to have a &amp;ldquo;rough&amp;rdquo; location
broadcast so people others can map your neighbourhood, but not your (latitude,
longitude)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cell phones don&amp;rsquo;t currently have LoRa (long range radio) capability built in,
but we can easily add that functionality via a Bluetooth accessory.&lt;/p>

Two phones message via LoRa devices they are each connected to.
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This recipe gives you &lt;strong>text messaging&lt;/strong> + GPS location over a mesh network.
The battery on the LoRa device should last a couple days, and not take much to
charge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The T1000e is the device I&amp;rsquo;m recommending. It works out of the box, requires
only a little setup, and there was no command-line hacking. You connect to it

&lt;p>NOTE: you need 1 x T1000e per person&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Meshtastic is an open-source project with builds mesh-networks via LoRa devices.
It&amp;rsquo;s been designed to work with a range of devices, and lets you configure them
via Bluetooth. It is also the main interface by which you message other peers in
the network - there is functionality for public messages, private group chat
(encrypted), and direct messages (encrypted)&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Pair your phone
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>turn on Bluetooth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>open the Meshtastic App&lt;/li>
&lt;li>go to Config &amp;#x2699;&amp;#xfe0f; tab (far-right)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>push the &lt;strong>(+)&lt;/strong> at bottom-right&lt;/li>
&lt;li>select your device, use default PIN &lt;code>123456&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set the spectrum
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>go to the Config &amp;#x2699;&amp;#xfe0f; tab&lt;/li>
&lt;li>open the &amp;ldquo;Region&amp;rdquo; dropdown, and pick &lt;code>ANZ&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the device will restart → &amp;#x1f3b5;&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>wait for device to restart → &amp;#x1f3b5;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&amp;#x26a0;&amp;#xfe0f; use a name other than your full legal name. Recommended because the device
by default reveals your approximate position (within 100m)&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>Turn off that beep!&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>When you receive a new message, the default behaviour of the Sensecap is
for it to beep repeatedly. You can dismiss that beeping by pushing the power
button on the Sensecap once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If dislike beeps (and are happy with just notifications on your phone):&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>Change your Position settings&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>By default this device broadcasts your approximate position (within 100m).
You can change this up or down depending on your context (safety/ privacy).&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Push the vertical ellipsis &lt;strong>⋮&lt;/strong> (top-right)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &amp;ldquo;Radio Config&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open &amp;ldquo;Position &amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change &amp;ldquo;Smart broadcast minimum distance (meters)&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the default is 100&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo;

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/details>
&lt;h2 id="important-info">Important Info
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Message delivery is not guaranteed.&lt;/strong> There are several ways a message may not
make it to the person you want it to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Your device is not in range of any other
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>e.g. you are alone in an isolated valley&lt;/li>
&lt;li>e.g. there are heaps of buildings blocking you in&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no pathway from you to your friend
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>your message makes it to another device, is passed on, &amp;hellip; but doesn&amp;rsquo;t
make it as far as your intended recipient&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Missing messages is a side-effect of Meshtastics approach to replicating data.
Not all mesh systems have this problem, and this is a space that is being
&lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/tiny-ssb" >actively researched&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design of Meshtastic does let you see &lt;strong>some&lt;/strong> information about delivery:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="direct-message-delivery">Direct Message Delivery
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In the case of direct messages, there are 4 symbols you see&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sending&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; a cloud &amp;#x2601;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>picked up by mesh&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; a cloud &amp;#x2601;&amp;#xfe0f; + &amp;#x2714;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>delivery confirmed&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; a person &amp;#x1f464; + &amp;#x2714;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>error?&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; a cloud &amp;#x2601;&amp;#xfe0f; with a line through it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="group-chat-delivery">Group Chat Delivery
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In group chats it is much less clear. You may get some confirmation of delivery,
but I would only trust this to mean it was acknowledged by &lt;em>some member&lt;/em> of that
group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should discuss with your community what your protocol is for adapting to
this. A simple one would be to put thumbs-up on messages that have been
received.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q: Can I do voice/ video calls?&lt;/strong> &lt;br />
A: No. This is optimised to be very low-energy comms, so does not support
high-bandwidth needed for live voice / video&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q: Can multiple phones connect to a T1000e?&lt;/strong>
A: I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Be aware that as it&amp;rsquo;s currently built your &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo; if bound
to your T1000e (not your phone), meaning if 2 phones are connected, they will
both be see to other mesh nodes as the same author.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>⏳ 2024 &amp;ndash; ongoing &lt;br />&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="about">About
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Mātou (&amp;ldquo;we are&amp;rdquo;) is a collective that exists to grow the digital infrastructure
needed to support transformational growth for Māori communities. Māori already
have centuries of experience in collective governance of shared resources and
distributed governance. The problem is that most &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; organisational tools
on offer are reflections of colonial patterns. See &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Conway&amp;rsquo;s
Law&lt;/a> :&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which
are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.&lt;/em>
— Melvin E. Conway&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In Aotearoa (New Zealand), this means that Māori are currently struggling to
organise collectively (as is their tradition) because most of the tools are
fundamentally propertarian/ individualist/ overly top-down&amp;hellip; in short, do not
serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core observation of &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/ahau" >Āhau&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;) was that we must start by
rebuilding right tools starting with &lt;strong>identity&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; this is the foundation by
which we know ourselves (through our history, our relationships), and from here
move into coordinating and building new things. Crucially, this &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> be
rooted in absolute sovereignty (no rented domain names, no foreign servers
controlling authorship, no singular source of truth).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a radical exploration of data-sovereign identity Āhau succeeded in part, but
ultimately surfaced challenges blocking our grand vision:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>identity tools must be &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong>&amp;hellip; but maintaining them with grants is
unsustainable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>each community has it&amp;rsquo;s own tikanga (cultural practice), and we cannot (and
should not) build for all of them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limited Liability Company governing an identity commons is a misalignment with
our &lt;a class="link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=kaupapa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>kaupapa&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mātou is being designed to be a multi-stakeholder entity which gives community
real say in the systems being built, fosters ecosystems, acknowledges and
rewards participation, growing wealth for all. Currently we are coordinating

&lt;h2 id="about">About
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Āhau is an desktop + phone application for creating collaborative family trees,
and the archiving of records which are linked to that family (photos, videos,
documents).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Te Ao Māori, relationships with family (and land) form the foundation from
which all identity, sense making, and coordination flow. Āhau was designed to
help strengthen this foundation, and be infrastructure that was held by the
people &amp;ndash; identity is precious taonga (treasure) after all.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make self-hosting accessible, Āhau was built on top of a peer-2-peer system
called &lt;a class="link" href="https://scuttlebutt.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scuttlebutt&lt;/a>. This put data in community hands
(not the company&amp;rsquo;s), and the distributed nature meant any servers were just
light-weight relays which anyone in a family could run from home on a computer.&lt;/p>

and identified that &amp;ldquo;recovery&amp;rdquo; (of secrets) was perhaps the number 1 challenge.&lt;/p>

Over the past 3 years, friends and I have
been growing and shaping an ecosystem for that purpose — for many, it’s now our
primary way of communicating. It’s built with cryptography and is p2p. The
result is a system with fundamentally different behaviours than the old web.
This is part of a series exploring the sociological and technological
ramifications. I call it “The Medium is the Message: Cypherspace Edition”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking at a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://re-publica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>re:publica&lt;/a> conference, my
friend &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.richdecibels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rich Bartlett&lt;/a> voiced his lack of faith
in blockchain as a solution for all that ails us. Specifically, he threw this
challenge:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“If you’re going to claim that your project is decentralising power, please
explain it in terms of justice, rather than just efficiency and
disintermediation.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This got me wondering how our project
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scuttlebutt&lt;/a>, a decentralised social network, is
any different from other hype. Most pressing was the question, “Can we
guarantee that people will be safe from bullying and abuse?” If we can’t build
a community which is free and open for everyone to participate in — if it’s a
space where some people are sexually harassed, or receive threats of violence —
then we’re wasting our time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our decentralised architecture certainly makes global spamming attacks hard,
and data only flows along lines of trust. But it’s still technically possible
for people to abuse others within our community, particularly if they have a
lot of friends in common. In our history to date, we’ve only had a few
incidents of behaviour and communication that run strongly against the
community culture I want to support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how have we dealt with abuse?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="just-kick-them-out">Just kick them out
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>On corporate platforms like Twitter, Youtube, or Facebook, there’s a single
central organisation with (essentially) a single data storage system. In that
context, it’s easy for the owners of the system to delete content or users — in
fact it’s their prerogative and, some would say, responsibility to do so. Most
platforms have a “report” or “flag” feature which marks content or users for
review/exclusion. This can be good, but also results in endless arguments about
these rulings, since policing and judging fairly is expensive and difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies like Reddit get around some of this overhead by being a platform for
community-moderated ‘subreddits’ (channels for specific topics). Sometimes
Reddit admins will still step in and ‘moderate’ user content, like when &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/26/reddits-ceo-regrets-trolling-trump-supporters-by-secretly-editing-their-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>their
CEO messed with Trump
posts&lt;/a>
, which was simultaneously funny and pretty troubling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a federated network, &lt;a class="link" href="https://mastodon.social/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mastodon&lt;/a> takes this a
step further — communities self-host their own ‘instances’ of the platform,
meaning there are many self-governing fiefdoms. Each sets their own rules and
can kick content and people off their instance. It’s great because there’s no
corporation shaping your experience, and you don’t need one policy to cover all
the people in the world. The challenge is you have to be fairly organised as a
group to set up and pay for the infrastructure, and to actively govern your
space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scuttlebutt goes even further: it’s fully decentralised, with no single central
organisation or federation of fiefs. There are only fully autonomous peers,
each running the software on their local computer and making their own choices
about how they want to interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>There is no owner of any shared physical space or hardware from which you
can kick a person&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the double edged sword of p2p social networks — it’s a space safe from
authoritarian interference &lt;em>and&lt;/em> it’s harder to assert boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="have-a-strong-culture">Have a strong culture
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As described above, this decentralisation might sound like total anarchy. It
is, but maybe preconceptions have coloured your expectation of how this might
pan out. In practice, what emerges is not that different to other networks —
people migrate toward and away from conversations and people they want to
interact with. We see ‘islands’ or ‘domains’ of community, which might be
distinct, overlapping, or totally disconnected. It’s similar to the dynamics of
Twitter, but while Twitter’s global space leaves it open for witch hunts and
hashtag storms, Scuttlebutt is more localised and stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is culture in such a fragmented space?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I can only talk about the parts of the Scuttleverse I interact with. It’s
filled with open-source programmers, communists, vegans, feminists, sailors,
and mycologists — and not capitalism or trolls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The community space around me has something like emergent governance. When
someone presents rough behaviour, it’s common for one or more people to
intercede and apply some combination of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>polite inquiry and clarifying questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>assertion of what sort of interaction they’d prefer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This costs time and energy, and it’s totally worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As individuals and as a group, we get the opportunity to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>check our assumptions, and (maybe) build connections with new cultures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>clarify our beliefs and who we are&lt;/li>
&lt;li>role model what respectful conversation and good boundary setting looks like&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our conflicts have advanced us individually, and as group we have built
stronger relationships and are more skilled and articulate. I absolutely
believe this is the fundamental and unavoidable work of community, and that
community is integral to any human ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is all really cool and cerebral, but does this stop rape threats?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(Hasn’t happened yet to my knowledge, but it’s a decent question.)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;em>information flows in a peer
network&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="block-them">Block them
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is the feature I’ve just finished building. Applying culture only gets you
so far — it can’t necessarily protect you from a malicious actor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an extreme situation, the things I want you to be able to avoid are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>being contacted by someone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being stalked by someone&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first one is easy to implement — you can just tell the interface to not
show anything new from that person. What I’ve built actually goes further, by
ceasing propagation of that person’s data to friends of yours not already
connected with this person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second part is harder. We’re a p2p network, where messages are &lt;a class="link" href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/gossiping-securely-is-the-new-email-6d706d4cd435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>gossiped
&lt;/a>—
how do you say things publicly and have them not get to that person? You tell
your friends that’s what you want, and they respect your decision!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In programmatic terms, a ‘block’ is just another type of message which is
gossiped. As soon as a peer receives it, their local setup effects the change
and tops passing information about you to the person you’re blocking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a p2p context, being blocked means you have fewer connected peers, because
the number of people gossiping your messages is reduced. Highly abusive
characters might find themselves enjoying just the freedom of their own speech,
alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-medium-is-the-message">&lt;strong>The Medium is the Message&lt;/strong>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Marshal McLuhan coined this &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>iconic
phrase&lt;/a>, and I’d
summarise it roughly as, “The physics of your medium determine what is possible
in that medium, and so ultimately the message.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given Scuttlebutt is a cypherspace (a space whose foundational physics is
cryptography), what is the nature of the medium that is different here, and
&lt;em>what is that message?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The underlying cryptography is what makes it possible for people to be totally
autonomous agents in this social network. It affords a level of freedom from
coercion that is probably unprecedented in a digital space. It also removes all
responsibility for governance or custodianship of a space from any particular
entity and devolves it to the level of individuals making choices. So far in
the Scuttleverse, I’ve seen this lead to a lot of personal responsibility and
growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s also fascinating to watch how the lack of dependence on shared hosting
infrastructure means that we can have a multiplicity of overlapping
communities. A recent example was when I found a user, who calls themselves
Johnny Null, in the &lt;em>#dads&lt;/em> channel (which I started because I’m going to be a
dad soon, and wanted to talk about that with other crypto-dads). I was
surprised, because I had experienced a lot of antagonistic threads with this
person, leading to some of my friends blocking him, but I hadn’t yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this new context, I wasn’t seeing unproductive abuse from him. We found
another way to connect on a really human topic. I was surprised to learn he was
a dad, and to receive encouragement and offers of support from him. It was such
a sharp contrast from previous interactions. The diversity of approaches
available made it possible for some people to block him, but he wasn’t banned
from the network, leaving open new possibilities. I don’t know where that will
go … but perhaps we could still have a chance at understanding each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I see alignment of the physics of p2p space and the physics of everyday
in-person space. It feels poetic that the way we’ve implemented a block in
Scuttlebutt is through communicating boundaries and asking our peers to respect
them. That’s how it works in offline spaces, too. I see this pattern a lot in
what we’re building — p2p interactions mirroring human interaction — and it’s
the heart of what I want to communicate by invoking The Medium is the Message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building systems with peers means the tools we build might be just a little
more human, and make space for adaptive communities. My hope is that this space
will help us re-learn some of what we’ve forgotten in society, and that maybe
this will make a difference in the rising challenges we have to face.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uncapturable Distribution</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/uncapturable-distribution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/uncapturable-distribution/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/uncapturable-distribution/galaxy.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Uncapturable Distribution" />&lt;p>So I hang out with a bunch of big dreaming nerds with a bunch of different
interests, but when we explore what it is we want in our future, it&amp;rsquo;s a happy
thriving civilisation. You&amp;rsquo;ll know we&amp;rsquo;re there because we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking after
each other, curiously exploring, sharing our successes, and making
intergalactic friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshops were about developing a Theory of Change for each group.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Theory of Change&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The process of forming a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Theory of
Change&lt;/a> is about
coming up with a map of how change will come about in the world. It starts by
a group building a shared vision of it&amp;rsquo;s particular desired end-state is.You
then proceed to build a graph of dependent states back from that end point to
the current state of the world. This is called &amp;lsquo;back-casting&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The process has several steps including things like surfacing and testing
assumptions, detailing how you would measure successful change at each step,
and assessing the cost and nature of intervention to prgress between states.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In each of the workshops, 2 hours of conversation made barely a dent in
completing a fully detailed map, but we&amp;rsquo;d revealed a lot of territory. Both
workshops explored similar veins, but here I&amp;rsquo;ll explore the second, because
it&amp;rsquo;s fresher in memory and highly relevant to my current work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-build-a-decentralised-database">Why build a decentralised database?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a workshop I ran with the Secure Scuttlebutt team who all happened to
be in San Francisco recently. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the top of our theory of change
diagram looked like :&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some important things we agreed we need to achieve were :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>specialisation without inequity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rich ecosystem (supports diverse approaches)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore one particular chain of states back. This format makes it
hard to simultaneously discuss the branching and interconnected dependencies,
so please forgive me if the analysis seems to narrow. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this
particular chain because it raised questions which provided a useful frame or
lens for projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on or with. From the top it reads :&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Galactic council&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Large scale social harmony&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Post scarcity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distribution primarily in service of society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distribution is distributed and un-ownable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We build our distribution on un-capturable technologies&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As distribution surfaced as a theme, we tested our assumptions against real-world examples :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>distribution of food and goods: supermarkets, walmart&lt;/li>
&lt;li>distribution of information: email, google, facebook&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We observed that &lt;strong>ownership&lt;/strong> of distribution by &lt;strong>actors mainly interested in
profit&lt;/strong> has lead to problematic dynamics which block us from joining the
Galactic Council. See massive food waste, destruction of diversity through
monopoly, development of tools which optimise addiction and consumption,
development of tools which define value for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="some-examples">Some examples
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of a couple of interesting cases in the context of
information distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[Email]&lt;/strong> : a super successful open protocol. Anyone can send emails to
anyone. The failing of email is that it has no mechanism for dealing with
un-wanted noise (see spam). This has generated a niche for organisations to
offer value (spam filtering), and capture users. For example Gmail is popular
because it does fairly reliable spam filtering. This makes email less open,
because small private servers have a harder time generating a good &amp;rsquo;not-spam&amp;rsquo;
reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Distribution systems must have a solution to noise.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[Facebook]&lt;/strong> : built on an open protocol - http - but has centralised closed
databases, and a closed (proprietary) interface. Facebook&amp;rsquo;s primary motivation
is profit, which inclines it to leverage it&amp;rsquo;s closed-ness (right of refusal of
access) to extract value from it&amp;rsquo;s user-base.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All parts of a distribution system need to be uncapturable - open protocols
are not sufficient&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>facebook ToS&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[Google]&lt;/strong> : the growth of the internet beyond easily navigable scales led to
the birth of search engines. The current winning solution to this problem is an
algorithm which determines site value based on linkages and references. Again,
this is a niche which has been captured by a primarily profit motivated
organisation. This capture looks something like a monopoly through dependence,
and is &lt;a class="link" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/25/search-googles-castle-moat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>defended by a suite of related free and powerful
tools&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Distribution systems need to address capturable searchability&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="things-you-should-consider">Things you should consider
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve named a bunch of assumptions and principles that we think need to be
integrated in order to get us on the road to The Galactic Council.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is your interaction with distribution systems, are you investing in
systems that build the future you want to see?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How do you network online, is it via an actor interested mostly in profit?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who holds power over the definition of value of what you&amp;rsquo;re interacting with?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where do you publish your content?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s overly idealistic to transition immediately to decentralised
uncapturable solutions, but there are small choices that we can and should
start making if we want to live in a thriving society.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.loomio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Loomio&lt;/a> (a collaborative decision-making
platform), we&amp;rsquo;ve addressed some of these same problems by a steadfast
commitment to being &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/loomio/loomio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>open-source&lt;/a>. While
individual instances of the platform may have closed databases, the
open-sourcing of the platform code means that anyone can own and control their
own instance. It also makes advertising and data-mining significantly less
likely, because anyone in the community can fork the code-base and rip anything
extractive out. For Loomio this is actually a selling point - it&amp;rsquo;s a clear
signal that our primary value is in serving society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Loomio, capturing ownership has also been very seriously addressed in how
we&amp;rsquo;ve written our constitution, and our approach to investment. In short, you
can&amp;rsquo;t buy Loomio, and no one person can control it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You might notice this isn&amp;rsquo;t published on medium. Honestly, this is an
experiment in document splicing using a tool I made currently called
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/mixmix/hypermarkdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hypermarkdown&lt;/a>. In retrospect this
approach does tick some boxes. This content is currently being hosted at
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/mixmix/blogposts/blob/master/uncapturable_distribution.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>github.com&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;
which sounds like my content might be captured buuuut, github is acutally built
on a distributed content system called &lt;a class="link" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>git&lt;/a>. An exact
mirror of the data lives on my computer as well, and could easily be hosted by
any git based server, like a self-hosted &lt;a class="link" href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>gitlab&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s still the problem of how it is you&amp;rsquo;ve found your way to this blog.
99.9% liklihood is that in 2015 it was via facebook, or twitter (it probably
wasn&amp;rsquo;t via google because the way I built this accidentally makes it harder to
index).&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s an open and secure decentralised database
where distribution flows along trust lines, as determined by following
(positive value) and flagging (negative value).&lt;/p>
