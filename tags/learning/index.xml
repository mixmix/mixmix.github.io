&lt;p>&lt;strong>Child&lt;/strong> : How come you get to eat icecream on the couch?
&lt;br/>
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : Because I have my Icecream Licence!&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This was intended as a joke but lead to me outlining the key competencies you
have to demonstrate to access this licence:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t spill icecream on the couch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you do, you notice it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You know how to clean spills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You actually clean those spills&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As of writing this, my oldest has the licence, my youngest has decided they&amp;rsquo;re
not ready for the responsibility yet, and happily eat at the table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? I was exhausted by repeat queries, and while &amp;ldquo;because I said so&amp;rdquo; is sometimes
appropriate, it&amp;rsquo;s more often a lazy response which doesn&amp;rsquo;t support learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reflections">Reflections
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Icecream Licence&lt;/strong> was bootstrapped directly off the Drivers Licence. In
the case of the car we want people to have agency in their life, and to balance
that freedom with the safety of other citizens. In the case of the
icecream, I want my kids to relax and have fun, AND I want a harmonious house
(one where I&amp;rsquo;m not yelling &lt;em>STICKY FINGERS ARGGHH!!!!&lt;/em> nor resentfully sponging
dairy out of soft furnishings).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My ultimate goal is for my kids to be fully autonomous, self-actualizing,
socially integrated humans. There are lot of places freedom is dangerous (to
self and/or others). The &amp;ldquo;Licence&amp;rdquo; is a really clear way to support people to
grow into that freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very similar to an education context, which works in &amp;ldquo;qualifications&amp;rdquo;,
often defined by &amp;ldquo;key competencies&amp;rdquo; which need to be demonstrated in some
way. Qualifications are usually used to boundary access to additional course/
programmes/ jobs. Licences are a sort of qualification which often boundary
something dangerous to an individual / group / system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qualifications and Licences are both awarded by &amp;ldquo;authorities&amp;rdquo; - entities we&amp;rsquo;ve
invested with the right to author, and to authorise (extend authorship/
autonomy). There&amp;rsquo;s a clear power dynamic in here, which needs some attention
and care. While I still often hold the ultimate authority, the shift has been
towards defining access to power, and supporting my kids to access that safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels great to shift from &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;No, because I said so&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, to &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Yes, when you can
demonstrate X,Y,Z, are you ready?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-licences">Creating Licences
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not everything should be a Licence. However we&amp;rsquo;ve found it a very succinct way
to communicate with our kids:
&lt;br />
a) There is something adult or dangerous here &amp;#x1f525;
&lt;br />
b) There is a pathway, I&amp;rsquo;m here to support you &amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some reflective questions to support you explore Licences:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-are-you-really-blocking-your-child">Why are you &lt;em>really&lt;/em> blocking your child?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably been giving your child &amp;ldquo;some reason(s)&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s likely
truncated because you lacked the time, and your child lacks context. Pause and
unpack it more fully. This provides hints about what your child might
need to learn / master.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>e.g. icecream isn&amp;rsquo;t directly dangerous, but it can attract animals, breed
microbes, damage relationships&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-doing-this-well-look-like">What does doing this well look like?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>You are likely unaware of how many points of context + skills are involved with
some domains. Happily, you can probably imagine a lot of ways your child
would fail. Use these as pointers to mapping our explicitly the pieces of
knowledge and skills required.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-you-fail-well-here">How do you &amp;ldquo;fail well&amp;rdquo; here?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Just because adults &amp;ldquo;know how to do something&amp;rdquo; does not mean they nail it every
time. A key aspect of mastery is knowing how to adapt &lt;strong>when&lt;/strong> failure occurs -
often this involves sensing failure early, and knowing how to gently correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>what does this look like when it goes wrong?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>what are the best options for recovering/ mitigating damage?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="could-this-licence-have-levels">Could this Licence have levels?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>How can we practice basics and succeed before adding more context/ complexity/
skills?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>e.g. ice-cream in a bowl, in a cone, with/ without chocolate sauce (see
Dangerous Goods Licence)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="licence-revocation">Licence revocation?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In our house you can definitely lose your Icecream Licence. Sounds kinda
punitive perhaps, but we&amp;rsquo;ve found having clear expectations about what&amp;rsquo;s
involved with a Licence makes it really easy to outline outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s totally ok to not want to have responsibility for everything all the time!
If you want to pause on some of those responsibilities, it just means that some
of your freedom/ autonomy may be curtailed. We align power with responsibility

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>These patterns were born of the death of a friendship. TL;DR we muddled
personal and work comms to the point where communication got confused, and
trust broke down. We managed to name the problem, but too late to be able to
recover. I was gutted &amp;ndash; I was naive, complicit, and had lost a dear friend. My
response was to start partitioning my comms, obsessively asking:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is the best space to relay this message into?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time this query has evolved
how I think and relate. Please enjoy a sampler of how I use Signal, presented
as an explorable simulacrum &amp;ndash; &lt;em>click in to read more about those you&amp;rsquo;re
curious about.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="work-chats">Work Chats
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>These were the first. In Signal I started creating dedicated 1:1 chats to
protect against this mistake. Here&amp;rsquo;s how that looks:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class='chats'>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>😀&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Ben&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>If I write something in here it&amp;rsquo;s me writing to Ben as a
friend. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry I&amp;rsquo;m coming at him with some work request, this
is about us connecting as friends.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details open=true>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>💼&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Ben/ Mix work&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>Work coordination. If it&amp;rsquo;s out-of-office hours, this can wait.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="family-chats">Family Chats
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Another reason I shifted hard into more exobrain use is also that having babies
turned my endobrain into mush. Gotta record everything or it&amp;rsquo;s gone. Here are
some chat groups that are just me and my partner &amp;ndash; our collective memory,
sense-making, and futuring.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class='chats'>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>🏡&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Family Admin&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>Boring but necessary house + kid stuff. I got scared that this would dominate all
my communication with my partner. Like the &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; chat above it allows us to protect
our relationship (somewhat) from the onslaught of logistics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon icon-first-aid'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Family Health Stuff&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>A memory augmenting channel. Dumping observations that are maybe insignificant,
but could be vital as part of a bigger arc is an easy win. Our whole family health
is in here, but to give you an idea, here&amp;rsquo;s a slice of one pattern we spotted that
lead to an escalation in care:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Time&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Message&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Sep 24, 11pm&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; right ear pain → paracetamol&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Nov 07, 8pm&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; right ear sore, stopped then started.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Feb 19, 10am&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; doctor says ear looks ok, referring to ENT&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Mar 12, 2am&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; woke with ear pain (left only)&lt;br /> - gave half paracetamol&lt;br /> - may have had some liquid come out (swimming, or burst drum?)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Mar 25, 8pm&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;lt;Daughter&amp;gt; ear seemed to clear &amp;ldquo;everything is so loud&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>We dump details about night wake-ups (invaluable for handing over care context),
medicine administered, readings (height/ weight/ blood pressure/ temperature),
questions for doctors, appointment times, notes from doctors visit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Format&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; &lt;code>name&lt;/code> + &lt;code>topic/ body area&lt;/code> + &lt;code>info&lt;/code> &lt;br />
Makes patterns easy to search. Timestamps are essential, but auto-added by chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>🌈&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Read/ Watch&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>A record of books / films / series that we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered and would like to
queue up. Raw titles alone means you lose the context for &lt;em>why&lt;/em> this caught your
attention, so I&amp;rsquo;d recommend a format like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>title&lt;/code> + &lt;code>genre&lt;/code> + &lt;code>link?&lt;/code> + &lt;code>why?&lt;/code>
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;div class='icon'>🎉&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='title'>Family Dreams&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='expand-symbol'>+&lt;/div>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;div class='body'>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Origin&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; My friend Richard and his partner have a bowl of cards, and on the cards
are written fun activities. When they&amp;rsquo;re bored they pull a card from the bowl, and
they&amp;rsquo;re off on adventure. I copied that. When my partner or I come across a recommended
location, fun kids activity, or upcoming event, they get dumped into this chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s like a shared memory space&amp;hellip; but for for possible futures. This
chat has increased our capacity for bringing dreams into the world. We started at
simple (&lt;em>Real Fruit Ice-cream&lt;/em>), and have grown in scale (&lt;em>International trip with
another family&lt;/em>), and depth (&lt;em>Take a night-class to explore this shy aspect of myself&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot recommend this pattern enough.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Origin&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; We have two young kids and wanted to remember some of the crack-up things
they&amp;rsquo;ve said.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Time&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Message&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Jan 14&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Son&lt;/strong> : I have the opposite program to most people. I have my dreams while I&amp;rsquo;m awake instead of while I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Apr 19&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Daughter&lt;/strong> : I feel bad, like I hurt someone&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s just that I fell in love with tacos&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Apr 21&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Daughter&lt;/strong> : hey I&amp;rsquo;m following you, you&amp;rsquo;re the role model&lt;br />&lt;strong>Grandma&lt;/strong>: don&amp;rsquo;t follow me &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t know where I&amp;rsquo;m going!&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; One of the greatest gift kids offer is the chance to see the world
afresh. Their observations are uncoloured by idioms, uncluttered by&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;grown up&amp;rsquo;
context? Their questions side-step social norms and drive (unknowing or sensing?)
into the heart of things. We&amp;rsquo;re invited to reflect on our assumptions, our knowledge,
what we really values, and to summarise those thoughts in under 2mins in simple terms.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>&lt;strong>mix&lt;/strong> : &amp;ldquo;remind me about leadership call&amp;rdquo;?! &lt;br /> &lt;strong>partner&lt;/strong> : thanks! I scheduled that message 5 days ago, you&amp;rsquo;re like my meatware in this situation &lt;br /> &lt;strong>mix&lt;/strong> : I am your meatware, that&amp;rsquo;s what we signed up for &lt;br /> &lt;strong>partner&lt;/strong> : awww&lt;/td>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; reflecting on what having a &amp;ldquo;premium subscription&amp;rdquo; might mean,
I noticed this channel was a perfect place to post post celebrations of beauty
we see unfolding in our lives, appreciation of one another, and the occasional
insights from therapy.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>

this started as a high-context, high-trust channel for my partner and I to
vent about those cringe or painful moments in life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evolution&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; Laughing together at a predicament is a quick way to affirm
shared values and step away from any fight/flight/freeze/fawn response.
If it&amp;rsquo;s not funny, then we can move into more careful support of each other.
Whatever the path, stabilisation/ alignment/ destressing make it easier to
engage curiosity, name the kernel of any conflict, explore upstream solutions,
etc.

&lt;p>This is a simple shared memory archive. When we decide on an iteration
of something we&amp;rsquo;d like to try out, we record it here. This helps us
loop back to reflect on how experiments have gone. Later this will likely
enable us to reflect on what we continue to struggle with, how far we&amp;rsquo;ve
come, and what our relationship is.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A support group for a group of 18 parents who were friends and happend
to have kids around the same time. This group has covered planning
playdates, re-sharing cool event, shared summer holidays for the past 4
years, hand-me-downs, baby-sitting, emergency support, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I deliberately added sharing of vulnerability to this group. I role-modelled
&lt;em>not knowing&lt;/em>, I asked for help. I was met with support, and observing
safety and care, others followed suit. I think this deepened relationships,
increased resilience, and turbo-charged our collective sense-making.

&lt;p>I met a nice guy at &lt;a class="link" href="https://dwebcamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dweb Camp&lt;/a>, and said &amp;ldquo;we should
keep in touch!&amp;rdquo;. He dropped me into a Signal chat with 23 people called
&amp;ldquo;Social Labryinth&amp;rdquo; with zero context. Turns out this was a group of people
that were mostly friends of his at the conference, along with a handful of
seemingly aligned odd-bods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have never seen such sustained and rich discourse beyond a conference. I
attribute this to the lovely host, their great taste in friends, and our
alignment in interests (all at a radical tech conference). This group went
on to birth another parallel group, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/decent-social" >online conference&lt;/a>,
and many of the people I met are now trusted peers and collaborators.&lt;/p>

I made it as a joke in 2023 and then forgot about it, only to stumble across
it a year later while searching my chat for clowns.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the past year this chat has evolved into a critical discourse on clowning,
their role as bridges between possible realities, and has been slowly gathering
real clowns who are now helping shape the conversation. Was I always a clown,
or am I becoming one?

&lt;p>I met an Ecologist at a conference, and really wanted to learn more about the
systems thinking lenses of Ecology, and how this person had been applying them
to groups. We are both short on time, so started a chat group as a way to
share learning through dialogue. Along the way we&amp;rsquo;ve been adding resources
and people that match the theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We could have just kept this as a DM chat, but opening this to trusted friends
we were able to share learning more widely while also building trust as we
observe mutual friends interacting.

>nonlinear&lt;/a>. We share a passion for building
human-centred digital commons. A major challenge is there are so many
open-source projects / tools that auditing and testing them as an
individual is overwhelming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The focus of this group is then &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;do you have a spare 30 mins to kick the
tyres on a project?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. We post links to things that have crossed our
radar &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;anyone seen this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, and either someone has or maybe we
co-ordinate a small scouting party to go test it out and report back.
Cheerleading is also welcome. This is gentle volunteering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Functionally we are surfacing aligned tools, extending our capacity to
sense, progressing common-good, and making friends.
&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="cybernetic-sovereignty">Cybernetic Sovereignty
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not sure how many are familiar with
&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics#Key_concepts_and_theories" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cybernetics&lt;/a>.
As a primer for those who things it&amp;rsquo;s just about cyborgs:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The central theme in cybernetics is feedback. Feedback is a process where the
observed outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways
that support the pursuit, maintenance, or disruption of particular
conditions, forming a circular causal relationship.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in the feedback loops present in our information systems.
In the above sections you see me externalising and collectivising large parts
of my memory, sense-making, and future dreaming. Concretely, Signal is now a
core part of my cybernetic feedback loop &amp;ndash; I take actions which effect a system,
and then I sense the reaction(s) of that system, which stimulated further actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Signal, because the accessibility and activation cost is very low, and
because Signal give a shit about privacy/ security. I would have to be in a bad
place to be doing this on a platform that reads the content (see Meta, Google),
or in any way shapes my feedback loops. To be crystal clear, feedback
manipulation you should watch for is any place algorithms are being tuned to
decide the relevance your posts/ events&amp;hellip; based on the advertising goals or
political agendas of the host corporation. DEI no longer in vogue? How do you
feel about you your discourse and event organising being tuned down, gradually
disappeared?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Signal is great, I am not happy about how fragile Signal is to
disruption. It&amp;rsquo;s feasible that someone dragging an anchor could cripple New
Zealand&amp;rsquo;s internet, severing me from my communities (and exobrain). If there
was a fantastic p2p replacement that had the right security trade-offs,
and accessible UX, I would jump.&lt;/p>

goblins. As our kids grew we had nick-names for them and some of these evolved
into a developmental progression of goblin-ness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the phases I have mapped so far :
&lt;br />&lt;/p>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 1. 🥔 Potato&lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>When humans are born&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re kinda par-baked compared to other animals, as
in they&amp;rsquo;re not ambulatory, and only just aware of their environment. Some
people talk about this as the &amp;ldquo;fourth trimester&amp;rdquo;. Somewhat uncharitably I call
this phase the Potato.&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 2. 👶 Chublin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Your goblin is somewhat active and has started looking a little rolley. They&amp;rsquo;ve
got creases part way down their limbs, big cheeks, and very little neck to
speak of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chubby goblin → Chublin.&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 3. 💩 Grublin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Your goblin has moved on to solids. They make a significantly larger mess
consuming food, and their output is a new level of nasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grubby goblin → Grublin&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2>4. 👹 Grumplin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Your grublin is growing a lot (which hurts) and they&amp;rsquo;ve also developed enough
theory of mind to realise they can say &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo;, and just straight up defy your
requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grumpy goblin → Grumplin&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
&lt;h2> 5. 👺 Squablin &lt;/h2>
&lt;/summary>
&lt;p>Higher cognitive functions are online, your goblin can now make reasoned
attacks on your authority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Squabling goblin → Squablin&lt;/p>
&lt;/details>

it really useful wherever there is high variability / unknowns in coordination.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planning-with-kids-chaos">Planning with &lt;del>kids&lt;/del> &lt;em>chaos&lt;/em>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When I had kids, organising hang-outs went from pretty simple to something much
more unstable. For example &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s meet at the zoo at 2pm&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; sounds easy
enough, but then toddlers don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily sleep on an exact schedule, and
there is a greater than zero chance someone could spew in the car on the way
there. Multiply these unknowns by the number of participants and it can be
pretty easy for plans to only semi-align, or totally bomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can generate feelings that range from &lt;em>mild stess&lt;/em> (am I waiting for X to
arrive before we go into the zoo?) through to &lt;em>total bummer&lt;/em> (I was really
looking forward to an adult conversation). A particularly painful failure mode
is the &amp;ldquo;after bedtime han-gout&amp;rdquo; where no children are present (read: &lt;strong>this is
my time off&lt;/strong>), where some kid need arises, you are wrenched back into duty, and
your plans are cancelled. Deep expectation-reality whiplash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your plans involved other people with limited resources, you&amp;rsquo;re probably
also carrying the cost to the group in mind e.g. their expectation-reality
whiplash, and the cost of having the try to re-schedule a hang out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="decomposing-the-problem">Decomposing the problem
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I noticed the crux of the pain for me was the sharp divergence of reality from
expectation. Why was this happening? I think because my internal narrative was
too binary, that is only had two modes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hangin out&lt;/code> ⇒ &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>no hangs&lt;/code> ⇒ &amp;#x1f62d;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What if we told a story which was more nuanced&amp;hellip; reduce the surprise of the
flip between these states. Could we take in all the variables, name and
acknowledged the uncertainty, and build our story on that? Sounds like it might
be too complex, but you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this pattern before ⇒ weather forecasts!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started experimenting with a friend I play
&lt;a class="link" href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/peach?view=spoiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Magic&lt;/a> with. Our
conversations shifted from being more of a roller-coaster:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : How are things looking for a game tonight? &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : &amp;#x1f44d; Yeah I&amp;rsquo;m on! See you at 8pm &lt;br />
&amp;hellip; &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : 😕 you coming? &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : 👀 yep, just running a little late&amp;hellip; &lt;br />
&amp;hellip; &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : 😔 Look I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry, I gotta cancel, child spewing&lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : 😭 oh no! good luck&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To a really smooth expectation ride:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : How are things looking for a game tonight? &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Eric&lt;/strong> : ☔ 30%, my youngest has a cold, stay tuned! &lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : ❤️‍🩹 No pressure this end&lt;br />
&lt;strong>Mix&lt;/strong> : ✨ Let me know if the stars align! Otherwise catch you another night&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="updated-forecast">Updated forecast
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the joys of this is that just like a weather forecast, your forecast of
the likelihood of a date working out can evolve over time:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⛈️ 40% we have quite a few &lt;a class="link" href="https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons" >lemons&lt;/a> on deck&lt;/li>
&lt;li>☁️ 60% grandma said she can take a kid!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>☀️ 85% sick child is asleep 🙌🤞&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want you can front-load a little context about the lemons (complexity/
challenges) that are introducing uncertainty, then subsequent updates can be really
brief, even just &amp;ldquo;20%&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrast this with trying to protect people from complexity (not wanting to
prematurely complicate or worry), but then feeling pressure to offer apologies,
AND explanation, AND &lt;strong>in the exact moment of some disaster unfolding&lt;/strong> &amp;#x1f44e;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="commitment--context">Commitment + Context
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One thing I immediately noticed was that communicating this way separated our
commitment to the relationship from the challenges of our context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I feel like generally people wanted to make a plan work &amp;ndash; to honour
the organising + time people have contributed, the relationship &amp;ndash; and that to
cancel plans felt like some damage that needed acknowledgement and repair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I it&amp;rsquo;s really easy for me to say:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f; I would love to hang out with you! (commitment)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>⛈️ 60%, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m working with (context)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>My commitment + context can now be expressed orthogonally 🤓. It feels like it
unlocks a lot more compassion / kindness, which is especially helpful for anyone
navigating relationships intersecting with complexity, be that kids, mental
health challenges, disability etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lemons 🍋🍋🍋</title><link>https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://mixmix.nz/p/lemons/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Lemons 🍋🍋🍋" />&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally published on Scuttlebutt in 2018. Additional section added with
updated learnings.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was a teacher I worked with this guy Pete Brailsford, who taught
mountaineering. He&amp;rsquo;d take students up into the snow and build snow caves to
sleep in overnight, cross rivers, stuff like that. A major part of the learning
in that context was about &lt;em>managing risks&lt;/em>. The idea is that you can&amp;rsquo;t control
everything, but you can keep an eye on the probability field you&amp;rsquo;re standing
in.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He talked about it like a slot machine - those ones where you pull the handle
and then the options spin and then they lock in like:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="cherries-lemon-cherries-cherries-green_apple">&amp;#x1f352; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f352; &amp;#x1f352; &amp;#x1f34f;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Normally if you get all cherries or something, it&amp;rsquo;s a jackpot, but in this
story, if you get a row of lemons, that&amp;rsquo;s bad, like &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;you got hypothermia and
no-one knows where you are&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you can&amp;rsquo;t control all the slots, but you can watch where you&amp;rsquo;re at. Say you
set out on our adventure, the slots are spinning, and you know what, someone in
our group forgot their jacket &lt;em>BOOM&lt;/em> the first slot just came up&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lemon-white_large_square-white_large_square-white_large_square-white_large_square">&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Ok it&amp;rsquo;s a lemon, but no big deal, it&amp;rsquo;s sunny as. You stop and have lunch,
there&amp;rsquo;s some clouds on the horizon, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>so warm&lt;/em>. Guess what you just
missed a hint, and as you continue to walk it starts to rain and a wind picks
up (being a small island in a massive ocean, weather can change &lt;em>very&lt;/em> quickly
in nz) &amp;hellip; now you&amp;rsquo;ve got 2 lemons&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lemon-lemon-white_large_square-white_large_square-white_large_square">&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c; &amp;#x2b1c;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Again this is not that big a deal&amp;hellip; except you already have that 1 lemon, so
now you&amp;rsquo;ve got someone in your group who&amp;rsquo;s getting cold. I guess you can see the
trend. Any one of these things is no big deal, but a series of little
misfortunes have a &lt;em>cumulative&lt;/em> effect in terms of the odds you&amp;rsquo;re playing
with. So if you&amp;rsquo;re in this position&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="lemon-lemon-lemon-lemon-white_large_square">&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x2b1c;
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re now playing a very high stakes games, where one more little lemon, like a
sprained ankle can tip you over into disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-manage-lemons">How to manage lemons
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Lemons aren&amp;rsquo;t always avoidable, but you can often plan ahead and consider what
the odds of lemons are based on different paths. Further, you can reflect as
situtations evolve, asking yourself:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How many lemons are we currently at?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Just having this self-reflective question in your toolbelt can change how you
think and see. It can be really hard to spot them because they can often be
innocuous in the context where they first present &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>in concert&lt;/em>
that the the real trouble manifests. Asking this question out loud to yourself
and your questing party can help you spot more of them early, as well as
increase the liklihood you&amp;rsquo;ll keep them in working memory (most humans suck at
remembering many small factors).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you spot yourself crossing 3-4 lemons, you should probably be starting to
significantly re-asses your plans. Things like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>abort&lt;/strong>: ask yourself if your initial plan is still safe&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>simplify&lt;/strong>: consider cutting non-vital parts of your plan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>alert&lt;/strong>: increase new-lemon vigilance, prepare to escalate responses faster&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="but-mix-im-not-a-mountaineer">But mix, I&amp;rsquo;m not a mountaineer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is relevant to anyone on any adventure (solo, or as a team). You could be
voyaging into literal mountains, or sailing to Great Barrier Island, or you could
be a distributed team building FOSS tools on a limited / no budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some lemons that have fucked up quests I&amp;rsquo;ve been on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>having no retrospectives (process for iterating, adaptation)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>just trusting that everyone remembers the agreement we made &lt;em>(contracts, pay,
expectations)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>forgetting to ask how people are feeling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;figuring it out later&amp;rdquo; for on-boarding / off-boarding / holidays / sick leave&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not telling each other vital quest-changing info &lt;em>(assuming mind-reading or
avoiding conflict)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being unclear on who&amp;rsquo;s doing what&lt;/li>
&lt;li>using too many different tools for communication / coordination&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being unclear about ownership / responsibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>saying &amp;ldquo;this is a flat structure, everyone is equal&amp;rdquo; (but not actually doing
anything to actively distribute power)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>forgetting to account for how disruptive travel can be&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sometimes the course you take has known lemons. Like it&amp;rsquo;s hard to set up
&lt;em>holiday pay&lt;/em> processes when you&amp;rsquo;re a small company and you know everyone and
you&amp;rsquo;re doing it for love and there are so many things to do. You just need to
acknowledge (and remember) that you&amp;rsquo;re carrying a lemon, and if you then try to
onboard someone new, you need to adjust your plan by either stopping to build
that missing stuff (unloading the lemon), or communicating to the new person
clearly about the known lemon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lemons-in-family-systems">Lemons in family systems
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>UPDATE: &lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;ve added this section because it&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;ve most used this
personally, and why I reference this pattern so often.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I say &amp;ldquo;family system&amp;rdquo;, I mean any group of people very strongly committed
to supporting one another, such that the wellbeing of any one person in the
system &lt;em>strongly&lt;/em> effects the wellbeing of the system as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples of family systems I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that this is relevant for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>parent(s) with kid(s)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>partners where at least one has a disability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>partners where at least one has mental health challenges&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You know if you&amp;rsquo;re in such a family system when e.g. one of you gets sick, and
the experience is like &lt;em>the family is sick&lt;/em>. The arc of recovery is often slower
too, because of the complex interactions involved in one person getting taken
out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="noticing-lemons">Noticing lemons
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t track lemons all the time in our family. Lemons in themselves are not
bad &amp;hellip; unattended compounding lemons tend towards disaster though. Typically we
start engaging this pattern when we notice ourselves generally &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>unreasonably&lt;/em> stressed&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>a bit&lt;/em> overwhelmed&amp;rdquo;, or even just &amp;ldquo;unproductive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step is to &lt;strong>pause&lt;/strong> and name the lemons we can spot. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit
overwhelmed today, so here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; work &amp;ndash; my work is in transition, lots of uncertainty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; community &amp;ndash; my school picnic got quagmired, lots of painful learning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; health &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve had a low level cold for 2 weeks, have had a few nights
of bad sleep&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Okeee, so we&amp;rsquo;re at 3 lemons already, and that&amp;rsquo;s only counting the complexities
I&amp;rsquo;m holding&amp;hellip; No wonder I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit overwhelmed!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="compassion">Compassion
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Even noticing that you&amp;rsquo;ve carrying a bunch of lemons can be transformative. My
first step is usually to laugh a little, and feel a little bit of relief &amp;ndash; &lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m
not useless, we have a lot on!&lt;/em> &amp;#x1f605;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having some compassion for ourselves can immediately unload shame / guilt /
pressure, which is &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> strategic, because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you just cut a meta-lemon (wasting brain cycles beating yourself up)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you likely have less of a white-knuckle death-grip on your initial plans,
making it easier to adapt to your actual reality&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="complexity-capacity-lemon-spoon">Complexity capacity &amp;#x1f34b; &amp;#x1f944;
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Another pattern we use in our family is &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Spoon
Theory&lt;/a>. The core idea is that if
you&amp;rsquo;re living with some disability you may have very limited capacity, and that
we could model how much capacity people have with units of capacity, spoons
&amp;#x1f944; say. A person with very limited capacity might start the day with 8
spoons, and then have to ration their spoons over the day e.g. shower costs 1
spoon, commute to work costs 2 spoons etc). If you run out of spoons&amp;hellip; maybe
you cannot get home, maybe you can but end up in massive spoon-debt (goodbye
tmrw).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expanding spoons from the individual (to collective capacity) and blending in
the lemons pattern, we can start to say things like &amp;ldquo;today we only have capacity
for 2 lemons&amp;rdquo;. Lemons here represent complexity which will incur spoons
(capacity) cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feels kind because it acknowledges our current capacity, and helps us bound
expectations of how much complexity we can perhaps carry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concretely, while going to a kids birthday in the morning followed by a friends bbq
in the afternoon may seem easy, if we only have 4 spoons, and
this plan takes us to 0 spoon exactly&amp;hellip; that leaves no capacity for unforeseen
lemons, which world put us in spoon deficit. Better to plan one just the one
activity and have spare capacity for curveballs and still be within safe
operating bounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This concept is also useful in the context of startups. Startups are typically
operating with very limited resources (spoons). Basic operations cost capacity
(spoons), and innovation tends to cost in unforeseen complexity (lemons). To that
end it&amp;rsquo;s important not to innovate on too many fronts simultaneously. Examples of
things which incur complexity cost:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; legal structures - e.g. coop, foundation + for-profit symbiosis, &amp;hellip;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; novel technologies - e.g. encrypted replicatable database&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; ethical investment mechanisms - e.g. non-voting shares, redeemable preference shares, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;#x1f34b; world-spanning teams - e.g. NZ, EU, USA&lt;/li>

I&amp;rsquo;m a coder with a background in maths - I excel at
taking ideas and problems apart. The blessing of this is that I understand
systems I work with intimately, perhaps even better than others. The curse is
that some-times my deep-analysis mode presents like &amp;ldquo;pointing out all the
problems&amp;rdquo;; a nay-sayer; a devils-advocate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you relate to any of things, welcome, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this for you - you have a
Black Hat. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because having a Black Hat is a super-power, and if
you&amp;rsquo;ve got one you&amp;rsquo;re probably deploying it sub-optimally. Here are a couple of
easy tweaks to get the most out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="know-when-to-use-it-and-keep-your-friends">Know when to use it (and keep your friends!)
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the context of collaboration, I&amp;rsquo;m fantastic at reviewing, seeing
vulnerabilities, and threats. Historically, I&amp;rsquo;ve also generated a lot of
pushback for quashing fledgling ideas, or &amp;lsquo;always seeing the negative&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.debonothinkingsystems.com/tools/6hats.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>de Bono&amp;rsquo;s thinking
hats&lt;/a>, has been a real
help for me. There are six of them, each representing a different style - or
mode - of thinking, de Bono proposed was that a lot of tension in a groups
emerges from different people being in different modes. (In computer security,
there are also &amp;lsquo;hats&amp;rsquo;, try the post-script for a mapping between the colours)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example in a visioning session, I deploy the Black Hat (critical thinking),
because it&amp;rsquo;s a strength of mine. Meanwhile others in the team are wearing the
Green Hat (generative, exploratory thinking). The combination feels bad,
because most people know that things being suggested aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect - that&amp;rsquo;s
not the point of the exercise at this point - but I&amp;rsquo;m doing the opposite of
creating, I&amp;rsquo;m bringing nothing to the table, I&amp;rsquo;m just cracking the things other
things are bringing open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m just leaning on my strengths - this is a common and
lazy habit of Black Hats. If you notice yourself being called a devils
advocate, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably fallen into this trap. Generally people don&amp;rsquo;t like
devils advocates and if you persist you&amp;rsquo;re in for a bad time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t use your hat, just know when to use it - check in
with your group about what &amp;lsquo;mode&amp;rsquo; we&amp;rsquo;re wanting to be in. If we&amp;rsquo;re doing
exploring, lets agree to be Green Hat, and then agree when we&amp;rsquo;re ready to shift
to stress testing the new ideas all at once (with our Black hats).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-be-think-critically-and-generatively">How to be think critically AND generatively
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is what I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about. It&amp;rsquo;s the realisation that you can use you
Black Hat to spot threats or weaknesses, and then put on a Yellow Hat. If the
Black Hat is the destructive critical thinking, the Yellow hat is the
future-facing critical thinking about our values. (This might not have been de
Bono&amp;rsquo;s intention, but bear with me.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, I&amp;rsquo;m currently teaching a group of coders at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.devacademy.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dev
Academy&lt;/a>. There&amp;rsquo;s this dynamic emerging where 3
of my students are excellent at asking questions. I noticed I was feeling
annoyed, and my Black Hat says &amp;ldquo;These students are dominating the air-space, to
the exclusion of the quieter students, and to the exclusion of the women in the
group&amp;rdquo;. It goes on &amp;ldquo;There are gender and societal dynamics at play here, I
wonder in what ways I could be contributing to this?&amp;rdquo;. The solution that comes
from this hats thinking is &amp;ldquo;You need to tell them to stop asking questions and
tell them we&amp;rsquo;re making the gender gap worse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this is kinda the desired outcome and there is truth in it, it lacks
compassion, and sure as hell isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be received well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By pivoting into my Yellow Hat, I&amp;rsquo;m able to ask the critical question &amp;ldquo;In what
ways is falling short of the desired values I want us to be living?&amp;rdquo; Which
leads to the subtle shift in focus &amp;ldquo;What are the values I want to be living
here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is easy and I kind of already knew it but it was tangled up in my
Black Hat deficit thinking. Clearly resolving &amp;ldquo;I want everyone to be practising
confident question asking, so they can be well equipped for their career.&amp;rdquo;
meant resolving the situation was a piece of cake. I invited the confident 3 to
a conversation, told them the value I wanted to realise, and invited them to
help me.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong> - applying critical thinking to underlying values (as well as the
problem) will help you see and communicate more clearly.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The difference between this solution and the Black Hat-only one is that it has
baked into it the aspirational end state. If others don&amp;rsquo;t agree with that
aspiration, that&amp;rsquo;s a fricken fantastic thing to talk about - you&amp;rsquo;re going to
skip out a bunch of painful mis-alignment.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Most of this learning was possible because of the incredibly supportive and nourishing atmosphere the Enspiral network is growing. Particular families I&amp;rsquo;ve had the priveldge of learning with / alongside are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.loomio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
