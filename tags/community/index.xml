&lt;p>Beautiful Signals is an event series engaging art practices and a series of
self-run workshops that explore emerging issues with soil, food, data,
democracy and digital sovereignty&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This was a project brought together by an emerging group of Pōneke activists/
programmers/ artists/ community organisers. I helped pull the website together,
and also hosted a workshop on &lt;a class="link" href="https://beautifulsignals.nz/workshops/maori_data_sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Māori Data
Sovereignty&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

whom I met through Scuttlebutt and Dweb Camp work. We wanted to continue
connecting, learning from one another, and to build more centres for connection
beyond the one we&amp;rsquo;d mostly been gathering around in California.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decent Social was a 24 hour rolling conference that spanned 3 timezones
(Asia-Pacific, Africa-Europe, and Americas). We (the organising team) put a lot
of work in making the event accessible, and safe for participants. I was the
regional host for Asia-Pacific, and on call for any moderation or Code of
Conduct issues.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
